** Stochastic Processes and \texorpdfstring{\(\sigma\)}{Ïƒ}-Fields
        A *stochastic process* is a mathematical model for the occurrence, at each moment after the initial
        time, of a random phenomenon. The randomness is captured by the introduction of a measurable space
        \((\Omega,\calf)\), called the *sample space*, on which probability measures can be placed. Thus, a
        stochastic process is a collection of random variables \(X=\{X_t:0\le t<\infty\}\) on
        \((\Omega,\calf)\), which take values in a second measurable space \((S,\cals)\), called the *state
        space*. For our purposes, the state space \((S,\cals)\) will be the \(d\)-dimensional Euclidean space
        equipped with the \(\sigma\)-field of Borel sets, i.e., \(S=\R^d\), \(\cals=\calb(\R^d)\), where
        \(\calb(U)\) will always be used to denote the smallest \(\sigma\)-field containing all open sets of a
        topological space \(U\). The index \(t\in[0,\infty)\) of the random variables \(X_t\) admits a
        convenient interpretation as *time*.
