    A *computability model* \(\bC\)  over a set \(\sfT\) of *type names* consists of
    * an indexed family \(\abs{\bC}=\{\bC(\tau)\mid\tau\in\sfT\}\) of sets, called the *datatypes* of \(\bC\)
    * for each \(\sigma,\tau\in\sfT\), a set \(\bC[\sigma,\tau]\) of partial functions \(f:\bC(\sigma)\to\bC(\tau)\), called the
      *operations* of \(\bC\)


    s.t.
    1. for each \(\tau\in\sfT\), the identity function \(\id:\bC(\tau)\to\bC(\tau)\) is in \(\bC(\tau,\tau)\)
    2. for any \(f\in\bC[\rho,\sigma]\) and \(g\in\bC[\sigma,\tau]\) we have \(g\circ f\in\bC[\rho,\tau]\) where \(\circ\) denotes ordinary
       composition of partial functions
    #+END_definition

    We shall use uppercase letters \(A,B,C,\dots\) to denote *occurrences* of sets within \(\abs{\bC}\):
    that is, sets \(\bC(\tau)\) implicitly tagged with a type name \tau. We shall write \(\bC[A,B]\)
    for \(\bC[\sigma,\tau]\) if \(A=\bC(\sigma)\) and \(B=\bC(\tau)\)

    In typical cases of interest, the operations of \(\bC\) will be 'computable' maps of some kind between datatypes

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

    A computability model \(\bC\) is *total* if every operation \(f\in\bC[A,B]\) is a total

    A computability model \(\bC\) has *weak (binary cartesian) products* if there is an operation
    assigning to each \(A,B\in\abs{\bC}\) a datatype \(A\bowtie B\in\abs{\bC}\) along with
    operations \(\pi_A\in\bC[A\bowtie B,A]\) and \(\pi_B\in\bC[A\bowtie B,B]\) (known as *projections*) s.t. for
    any \(f\in\bC[C,A]\) and \(g\in\bC[C,B]\) there exists \(\la f,g\ra\in\bC[C,A\bowtie B]\) satisfying the following for
    all \(c\in C\)
    1. \(\la f,g\ra(c)\downarrow\) iff \(f(c)\downarrow\) and \(g(c)\downarrow\)
    2. \(\pi_A(\la f,g\ra(c))=f(c)\) and \(\pi_B(\la f,g\ra(c))=g(c)\)


    We say that \(d\in A\bowtie B\) *represents* the pair \((a,b)\) if \(\pi_A(d)=a\) and \(\pi_B(d)=b\)
    #+END_definition

    In contrast to the usual definition of categorical products, the operation \(\la f,g\ra\) need not be
    unique, since many elements of \(A\bowtie B\) may represent the same pair \((a,b)\). We do not formally
    require that every \((a,b)\) is represented in \(A\bowtie B\), though in all cases of interest this will be
    so. The reader is also warned that \(\pi_A\circ\la f,g\ra\) will not in general coincide with \(f\) .

    A *weak terminal* in a computability model \(\bC\) consists of a datatype \(I\in\abs{\bC}\) and an
    element \(i\in I\) s.t. for any \(A\in\abs{\bC}\) the constant function \(\Lambda a.i\) is in \(\bC[A,I]\)
    #+END_definition

    If \(\bC\) has weak products and a weak terminal \((I,i)\), then for any \(A\in\abs{\bC}\) there is an
    operation \(t_A\in\bC[A,I\bowtie A]\) s.t. \(\pi_A\circ t_A=\id_A\)

    untyped \lambda-calculus

    Terms \(M\) of the \lambda-calculus are generated from a set of variable symbols \(x\) by means of the following
    grammar:
    \begin{equation*}
    M::=x\mid MM'\mid\lambda x.M
    \end{equation*}
    Writing \(\sfL\) for the quotient set \(\Lambda/=_\beta\)

    We write \(M[x\mapsto N]\) for the result of substituting \(N\) for all free occurrences of \(x\)
    within \(M\)

    We define \Lambda  to be the set of untyped \lambda-terms modulo \alpha-equivalence.

    Let \(\sim\) be any equivalence relation on \Lambda with the following properties:
    \begin{equation*}
    (\lambda x.M)N\sim M[x\mapsto N],\quad M\sim N\Rightarrow PM\sim PN
    \end{equation*}
    1. \((\lambda x.x)M\sim M\)
    2. If \(M\sim N\), then \((\lambda x.N)M\sim(\lambda x.M)N\) and hence \(N\sim M\).
    3. If \(M\sim N\) and \(N\sim O\), then

    Then we have \(M\sim N\Rightarrow MP\sim NP\) since \((\lambda y.yP)M\sim(\lambda y.yP)N\Rightarrow MP\sim NP\).

    As a example, we may define \(=_\beta\) to be the smallest equivalence relation \(\sim\) satisfying the
    above properties and also
    \begin{equation*}
    M\sim N\Rightarrow \lambda x.M\sim\lambda x.N
    \end{equation*}

    Writing \([M]\) for the \(\sim\)-equivalence class of \(M\), any term \(P\in A\) induces a
    well-defined mapping \([M]\mapsto[PM]\) on \(\Lambda/\sim\). The mappings induced by some \(P\) in this way are
    called *\lambda-definable*

    We may regard \(\Lambda/\sim\) as a total computability model: the sole datatype is \(\Lambda/\sim\) itself, and
    the operations on it are exactly the \lambda-definable mappings. It also has weak products: a
    pair \((M,N)\) may be represented by the term \(pair\;M\;N\) where \(pair=\lambda xyz.zxy\)
    the terms \(fst=\lambda p.p(\lambda xy.x)\) and \(snd=\lambda p.p(\lambda xy.y)\). We can check that
    \(fst(pair\; M\;N)\sim M\) and \(snd(pair\;M\;N)\sim N\)

    We can also obtain a submodel \(\Lambda^0/\sim\) consisting of the equivalence classes of closed terms \(M\)

    Let \(B\) be any family of *base sets*, and let \(\la B\ra\) denote the family of sets generated
    from \(B\) by adding the singleton set \(1=\{()\}\) and closing under binary products \(X\times Y\) and
    set-theoretic function spaces \(Y^X\). We shall consider some computability models whose family
    of datatypes is \(\la B\ra\)

    First we may define a computability model \(\sfS(B)\) with \(\abs{\sfS(B)}=\la B\ra\) (often called
    the *full set-theoretic model over* \(B\)) by letting \(\sfS(B)[X,Y]\) consist of all
    set-theoretic functions \(X\to Y\) for \(X,Y\in\la B\ra\); that is, we consider all functions to be
    computable. However this model is of limited interest since it does not represent an interesting
    concept of computability

    To do better we may start by noting that whatever the 'computable' functions between these sets
    are supposed to be, it is reasonable to expect that they will enjoy the following closure
    properties
    1. For any \(X\in\la B\ra\), the unique function \(X\to 1\) is computable
    2. For any \(X,Y\in\la B\ra\), the projections \(X\times Y\to X\), \(X\times Y\to Y\) is computable
    3. For any \(X,Y\in\la B\ra\), the application function \(Y^X\times X\to Y\) is computable
    4. If \(f:Z\to X\) and \(g:Z\to Y\) is computable, so is their pairing \((f,g):Z\to X\times Y\)
    5. If \(f:X\to Y\) and \(g:Y\to Z\) are computable, so is their composition \(g\circ f:X\to Z\)
    6. If \(f:Z\times X\to Y\) is computable, so is its transpose \(\hatf:Z\to Y^X\)


    One possible approach is therefore to start by specifying some set \(C\) of functions between
    out datatypes that we wish to regard as "basic computable operations", and define a
    computability model \(\sfK(B;C)\) over \(\la B\ra\) whose operations are exactly the functions
    generated from \(C\) under the above closure conditions

    Take \(B=\{\N\}\); we shall often denote \(\sfS(\{\N\})\) by \(\sfS\). Let \(C\) consist of the
    following basic operations: the zero function \(\Lambda x.0:\N\to 1\), the successor function \(suc:\N\to\N\);
    and for each \(X\in\la B\ra\), the primitive recursion operator \(rec_X:(X\times X^{X\times\N}\times\N)\to X\) defined by
    \begin{align*}
    &rec_X(x,f,0)=0\\
    &rec_X(x,f,n+1)=f(rec_X(x,f,n),n)
    \end{align*}
    the resulting model \(\sfK(B;C)\) consists of exactly those operations of \(\sfS\) definable in
    Gödel's *System T*

*** Weakly Cartesian Closed Models
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

    label:3.1.8
    Suppose \(\bC\) has weak products and a weak terminal. We say \(\bC\) is *weakly cartesian closed* if
    it is endowed with the following for each \(A,B\in\abs{\bC}\):
    * a choice of datatype \(A\Rightarrow B\in\abs{\bC}\)
    * a partial function \(\cdot_{AB}:(A\Rightarrow B)\times A\rhu B\), external to the structure of \(\bC\)


    s.t. for any partial function \(f:C\times A\rhu B\) the following are equivalent
    1. \(f\) is represented by some \(\barf:\C[C\bowtie A,B]\), in the sense that if \(d\)
       represents \((c,a)\) then \(\barf(d)\simeq f(c,a)\)
    2. \(f\) is represented by some total operation \(\hatf:\bC[C,A\Rightarrow B]\), in the sense that
       \begin{equation*}
       \forall c\in C,a\in A\quad\hatf(c)\cdot_{AB}a\simeq f(c,a)
       \end{equation*}
    #+END_definition

    \(\cdot_{AB}\) is represented by an operation \(app_{AB}\in\C[(A\Rightarrow B)\bowtie A,B]\)

    Crucially, and in contrast to the definition of cartesian closed category, there is no
    requirement that \(f\) is unique. This highlights an important feature of our framework: in many
    models of interest, elements of \(A\Rightarrow B\) will be *intensional* objects (programs or algorithms),
    and there may be many intensional objects giving rise to the same partial function \(A\to B\)

    Consider again the model of Example ref:3.1.5, comprising the partial Turing-computable
    functions \(\N\rhu\N\). Here \(\N\Rightarrow\N\) can only be \(\N\), so we must provide a suitable
    operation \(\cdot:\N\times\N\to\N\). This is done using the concept of a *universal Turing machine*.
    Let \(T_0, T_1,\dots\)  be some sensibly chosen enumeration of all Turing machines for computing
    partial functions \(\N\rhu\N\). Then there is a Turing machine that accepts two inputs \(e,a\) and
    returns the result of applying the machine \(T_e\) to the single input \(a\). We may therefore
    take \(\cdot\) to be the partial function computed by \(U\)

    Clearly the partial functions \(f:\N\times\N\rhu\N\)  representable within the model via the pairing
    operation from Example ref:3.1.5 are just the partial computable ones. We may also see that
    these coincide exactly with those represented by some total computable \(\barf:\N\to\N\), in the
    sense that \(f(c,a)\simeq\tilf(c)\cdot a\).

    \(\Leftarrow\): Given a computable \(\tilf\) the operation \(\Lambda(c,a).\tilf(c)\cdot a\) is clearly computable

    \(\Rightarrow\): \(s\)-\(m\)-\(n\) theorem

    When endowed with this weakly cartisian closed structure, this computability model is known as
    *Kleene's first model* of \(K_1\)

    sole datatype in this model. Set \(\sfL\Rightarrow\sfL=\sfL\bowtie\sfL=\sfL\). We may obtain a weakly cartesian
    closed structure by letting \(\cdot\) be given by application. If \(M\in\Lambda\) induces an operation
    in \([\sfL\bowtie \sfL,\sfL]\) representing some \(f:\sfL\times\sfL\to\sfL\), then \(\lambda x.\lambda y.M(pair\;x\;y)\)
    induces the corresponding operation in \([\sfL,\sfL\Rightarrow\sfL]\); conversely if \(N\) induces an
    operation in \([\sfL,\sfL\Rightarrow\sfL]\) then \(\lambda z.N(fst\;z)(snd\;z)\) induces the corresponding one
    in \([\sfL\bowtie\sfL,\sfL]\)

    For models of the form \(\sfK(B;C)\), we naturally define \(X\Rightarrow Y=Y^X\) and take \(\cdot_{XY}\) to be
    ordinary function application. These models are endowed with binary products, and it is
    immediate from closure condition 6 in Example ref:3.1.7 that they are weakly cartesian closed

    Such models show that not every element of \(X\Rightarrow Y\) need represent an operation in \(\bC[X,Y]\),
    or equivalently one in \(\bC[1,X\Rightarrow Y]\). This accords with the idea that our models consist of
    'computable' operations acting on potentially 'non-computable' data: operations in \(\bC[X,Y]\)
    are computable, whereas elements of \(X\) need not be

    #+BEGIN_definition
    A *higher-order structure* is a computability model \(\bC\) possessing a weak terminal \((I,i)\) and
    endowed with the following for each \(A,B\in\abs{\bC}\)
    * a choice of datatype \(A\Rightarrow B\in\abs{\bC}\)
    * a partial function \(\cdot_{AB}:(A\Rightarrow B)\times A\rhu B\)
    #+END_definition

    We treat \(\Rightarrow\) as right-associative and \(\cdot\) as left-associative

    The significance of the weak terminal \((I,i)\) here is that it allows us to pick out a
    subset \(A^\sharp\) of each \(A\in\abs{\bC}\), namely the set of elements of the form \(f(i)\)
    where \(f\in\bC[I,A]\) and \(f(i)\downarrow\).

    This is independent of the choice of \((I,i)\): if \(a=f(i)\) and \((J,j)\) is another weak
    terminal, then composing \(f\) with \(\Lambda x.i\in\bC[J,I]\) gives \(f'\in\bC[J,A]\) with \(f'(j)=a\).

    Intuitively, we think of \(A^\sharp\) as playing the role of the 'computable' elements of \(A\), and \(i\) as
    some generic computable element.
    On the one hand, if \(a\in A\) were computable, we would expect each
    \(\Lambda x.a\) to be computable so that \(a\in A^\sharp\); on the other hand, the image of a computable element
    under a computable operation should be computable, so that every element of \(A^\sharp\) is
    computable.

    A higher-order structure is a higher-order model iff it is a full substructure of a weakly
    cartesian closed model
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Let \(\bC\) be a higher-order structure.

    \(\Leftarrow\): suppose \(\bD\) is weakly cartesian closed and \(\bC\) is a
    full substructure of \(\bD\) with a weak terminal \((I,i)\)
    1. For any \(f\in\bC[A,B]=\bD[A,B]\) we have that \(f\circ\pi_A\in\bD[I\bowtie A,B]\) represents \(\Lambda(x,a).f(a)\),
       which by definition ref:3.1.8 is in turn represented by some total \(\hatf\in\bD[I,A\Rightarrow B]\).

       Conversely, given \(f:A\rhu B\) and \(\hatf\in\bC[I,A\Rightarrow B]\) with \(\hatf(i)\downarrow\)
       and \(\hatf(i)\cdot a\simeq f(a)\) for all \(a\), take \(\hatg=\hatf\circ(\Lambda x.i)\in\bC[I,A\Rightarrow B]=\bD[I,A\Rightarrow B]\) so
       that \(\hatg\) is total and represents \(g=\Lambda(x,a).f(a):I\times A\rhu B\). Now
       let \(\barg\in\bD[I\bowtie A,B]\) also represents \(g\). Then \(\barg\circ\la\Lambda a.i,\id_A\ra\in\bD[A,B]=\bC[A,B]\) and
       it is routine to check that \(\barg\circ\la\Lambda a.i,\id_A\ra=f\)

    2. Suppose \(A,B\in\abs{\bC}\). Let \(k'\in\bD[A,B\Rightarrow A]\) correspond to \(\pi_A\in\bD[A\bowtie B,A]\) as in
       definition ref:3.1.8, then \(k'(a)\cdot b\simeq\pi_A(d)\). Let \(\hatk'\in\bD[I,A\Rightarrow(B\Rightarrow A)]\) correspond
       to \(k'\circ\pi_A'\in\bD[I\bowtie A,B\Rightarrow A]\) where \(\pi_A'\in\bD[I\bowtie A,A]\) and take \(k=\hatk'(i)\)
       \(k\cdot a\cdot b=\hatk'(i)\cdot a\cdot b=(k'\circ\pi_A'(i,a))\cdot b=k'(a)\cdot b=a\)

    3.

    \(\Rightarrow\): Suppose \(\bC\) is a higher-order model, with \((I,i)\) a weak terminal. We build a weakly
    cartesian closed model \(\bC^\times\) into which \(\bC\) embeds fully as follows:
    * Datatypes of \(\bC^\times\) are sets \(A_0\times\dots\times A_{m-1}\), where \(m>0\) and \(A_0,\dots,A_{m-1}\in\abs{\bC}\)
    * If \(D=A_0\times\dots\times A_{m-1}\) and \(E=B_0\times\dots\times B_{n-1}\) where \(m,n>0\) the operations
      in \(\bC^\times[D,E]\) are those partial functions \(f:D\rhu E\) of the form
      \begin{equation*}
      f=\Lambda(a_0,\dots,a_{m-1}).(f_0\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1},\dots,f_{n-1}\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1})
      \end{equation*}
      where \(f_j\in(A_0\Rightarrow\dots\Rightarrow A_{m-1}\Rightarrow B_j)^\sharp\) for each \(j\); we say that \(f_0,\dots,f_{n-1}\) *witness*
      the operation \(f\). Note that for \((f_0\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1},\dots,f_{n-1}\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1})\) to be
      defined, it is necessary that all its components be defined


    It remains to check the relevant properties of \(\bC^\times\). That \(\bC^\times\) is a computability model is
    straightforward: the existence of identities follows from part 1 of Proposition ref:3.1.14
    and composition from part 2. \(\bC^\times\) has standard products and that \((I,i)\) is a weak terminal
    in \(\bC^\times\).

    Now let's show that \(\bC^\times\) is weakly cartesian closed. Given \(D=A_0\times\dots\times A_{m-1}\)
    and \(E=B_0\times\dots\times B_{n-1}\) with \(m,n>0\), take \(C_j=A_0\Rightarrow\dots\Rightarrow A_{m-1}\Rightarrow B_j\) for each \(j\), and
    let \(D\Rightarrow E\) be the set of tuples \((f_0,\dots,f_{n-1})\in C_0\times\dots\times C_{n-1}\) witnessing operations
    in \(\bC^\times[D,E]\). The application \(\cdot_{DE}\) is then given by
    \begin{equation*}
    (f_0,\dots,f_{n-1})\cdot_{DE}(a_0,\dots,a_{m-1})\simeq(f_0\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1},\dots,f_{n-1}\cdot a_0\cdot\dots\cdot a_{m-1})
    \end{equation*}

    Next, given an operation \(g\in\bC^\times[G\times D,E]\) witnessed by operations \(g_0,\dots,g_{n-1}\) in \(\bC\),
    take \(g_0^\dagger,\dots,g_{n-1}^\dagger\) as in Proposition ref:3.1.14 (3); then \(g_0^\dagger,\dots,g_{n-1}^\dagger\) witness
    the corresponding total operation \(\hatg\in\bC^\times[G,D\Rightarrow E]\). Conversely, the witnesses for any such
    total \(\hatg\) also witness the corresponding \(g\)

       A TPCA is *total* if all the application operations \(\cdot_{AB}\) are total
    #+END_definition

    Any higher-order model yields an underlying TPCA. However, in passing to this TPCA we lose the

    1. If \(\bA^\circ\) denotes a partial applicative structure, a *partial applicative
       substructure* \(\bA^\sharp\) of \(\bA^\circ\) consists of a subset \(A^\sharp\subseteq A\) for each \(A\in\abs{\bA^\circ}\) s.t.
       * if \(f\in(A\Rightarrow B)^\sharp\), \(a\in A^\sharp\) and \(f\cdot a\downarrow\) in \(\bA^\circ\), then \(f\cdot a\in B^\sharp\)

       such a pair \((\bA^\circ;\bA^\sharp)\) is called a *relative partial applicative structure*

    2. A *relative TPCA* is a relative partial applicative structure \((\bA^\circ,\bA^\sharp)\) s.t. there exist
       elements \(k_{AB}, s_{ABC}\) in \(\bA^\sharp\) witnessing that \(\bA^\circ\) is a TPCA
    #+END_definition

    A relative TPCA \((\bA^\circ,\bA^\sharp)\) is *full* if \(\bA^\sharp=\bA^\circ\). We will use \(\bA\) to range over both
    ordinary TPCAs and relative ones (writing \(\bA^\circ\), \(\bA^\sharp\) for the two components of \(\bA\) in
    the latter case), so that in effect we identify an ordinary TPCA \(\bA\) with the relative
    TPCA \((\bA;\bA)\). Indeed, we may sometimes refer to ordinary TPCAs as 'full TPCAs' . Clearly the
    models \(K_1\) and \(\Lambda/\sim\) are full, while in general \(\sfK(B;C)\) is not: rather, it is a
    relative TPCA \(\bA\) in which \(\bA^\circ\) is a full set-theoretic type structure whilst \(\bA^\sharp\)
    consists of only the \(C\)-computable elements

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_theorem
    There is a canonical bijection between higher-order models and relative TPCAs
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    First suppose \(\bC\) is a higher-order model, and let \(\bA^\circ\) be its underlying partial
    applicative structure. Take \((I,i)\) a weak terminal in \(\bC\), and for any \(A\in\abs{\bC}\),
    define \(A^\sharp=\{g(i)\mid g\in\bC[I,A],g(i)\downarrow\}\). As noted there, this is independent of the choice
    of \((I,i)\); in fact, it is easy to see that \(a\in A^\sharp\) iff \((A,a)\) is a weak terminal. To
    see that the \(A^\sharp\) form an applicative substructure, suppose \(f\in(A\Rightarrow B)^\sharp\) is witnessed
    by \(f'\in\bC[I,A\Rightarrow B]\) and \(a\in A^\sharp\) is witnessed by \(a'\in\bC[I,A]\), and suppose further
    that \(f\cdot a=b\). Take \(\check{f'}\in\bC[A\Rightarrow B]\) corresponding to \(f'\); then \(\check{f'}(a)=b\)
    and so \(\check{f'}\circ a'\) witnesses \(b\in B^\sharp\)

    Let \(\bA^\sharp\) denote the substructure formed by the sets \(A^\sharp\). It is directly build into
    Definition ref:def3.1.13 that there are elements \(k_{AB}, s_{ABC}\) in \(\bA^\sharp\) with the
    properties required by Definition ref:3.1.16; thus \((\bA^\circ;\bA^\sharp)\) is a relative TPCA

    For the converse, suppose \(\bA\) is a relative TPCA. Take \(\abs{\bC}=\abs{\bA^\circ}\) and
    for \(A,B\in\abs{\bC}\), let \(\bC[A,B]\) consist of all partial functions \(\Lambda a.f\cdot a\)
    for \(f\in(A\Rightarrow B)^\sharp\). To see that \(\bC\) has identities, for any \(A\in\abs{\bC}\), we have
    \begin{equation*}
    i_A=s_{A(A\Rightarrow A)A}\cdot k_{A(A\Rightarrow A)}\cdot k_{AA}\in(A\Rightarrow A)^\sharp
    \end{equation*}
    and clearly \(i_A\) induces \(\id_A\in\bC[A,A]\).  For composition, given
    operations \(f\in\bC[A,B]\), \(g\in\bC[B,C]\) induced by \(f'\in(A\Rightarrow B)^\sharp\), \(g'\in(B\Rightarrow C)^\sharp\), we have
    that \(g\circ f\in\bC[A,C]\) is induced by \(s_{ABC}\cdot(k_{(B\Rightarrow C)}\cdot g)\cdot f\). Thus \(\bC\) is a computability
    mode

    For a weak terminal, take any \(U\in\abs{\bC}\) and let \(I=U\Rightarrow U\) and \(i=i_U\) as defined above.
    Then for any \(A\) we have that \(k_{IA}\cdot i\in(A\Rightarrow U\Rightarrow U)^\sharp\) induces \(\Lambda a.i\in\bC[A,I]\)

    To turn \(\bC\) into a higher-order structure, we take \(\Rightarrow\) and \(\cdot\) as in \(\bA^\circ\). We may now
    verify that for any \(A\) we have
    \begin{equation*}
    A^\sharp=\{g(i)\mid g\in\bC[I,A],g(i)\downarrow\}
    \end{equation*}
    so that the present meaning of \(A^\sharp\) coincides with its meaning in Section ref:3.1.4. For
    given \(a\in A^\sharp\) we have \(k_{AI}\cdot a\in(I\Rightarrow A)^\sharp\) inducing an operation \(g\) with \(g(i)=a\).
    Conversely, given \(g\in\bC[I,A]\) with \(g(i)\downarrow\) we have that \(g(i)=g'\cdot i\) for
    some \(g'\in(I\Rightarrow A)^\sharp\) (by definition, \(g\) is of the form \(\Lambda a.f\cdot a\)); but \(i\in I^\sharp\) so \(g(i)\in A^\sharp\)

    By applying the above equation to the type \(A\Rightarrow B\), we see that conditions 1 and 2 of
    Definition ref:3.1.13 are satisfied, and conditions 3 and 4 are immediate from the \(k,s\)
    conditions in Definition ref:3.1.16. Thus \(\bC\) is a higher-order model
    #+END_proof

    In the setting of a relative TPCA \(\bA\), we have a natural *degree structure* on the elements
    of \(\bA^\circ\). Specifically, if \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\) where \(A,B\in\abs{\bA^\circ}\), let us
    write \(a\gg b\) if there exists \(f\in\bA^\sharp(A\Rightarrow B)\) with \(f\cdot a=b\)

    If \(\abs{\bA}\) consists of just a single datatype, then TPCA is just a single set \(A\) equipped
    with a partial 'application' operation \(\cdot:A\times A\rhu A\) s.t. for some \(k,s\in A\) we have
    \begin{equation*}
    \forall x,y.k\cdot x\cdot y=x,\quad\forall x,y.s\cdot x\cdot y\downarrow,\quad\forall x,y,z.s\cdot x\cdot y\cdot z\simeq(x\cdot z)\cdot(y\cdot z)
    \end{equation*}
    We call such a structure an *partial combinatory algebra* (or PCA)
*** Lax Models
    For simplicity, we have worked so far with a simple definition of computability model in which
    operations are required to be closed under ordinary composition of partial functions. It turns
    out, however, that with a few refinements, practically all the general theory presented in this
    chapter goes through under a somewhat milder assumption.

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    A *lax computability model* \(\bC\)  over a set \(\sfT\) of *type names* consists of
    * an indexed family \(\abs{\bC}=\{\bC(\tau)\mid\tau\in\sfT\}\) of sets, called the *datatypes* of \(\bC\)
    * for each \(\sigma,\tau\in\sfT\), a set \(\bC[\sigma,\tau]\) of partial functions \(f:\bC(\sigma)\to\bC(\tau)\), called the
      *operations* of \(\bC\)


    s.t.
    1. for each \(\tau\in\sfT\), the identity function \(\id:\bC(\tau)\to\bC(\tau)\) is in \(\bC(\tau,\tau)\)
    2. for any \(f\in\bC[\rho,\sigma]\) and \(g\in\bC[\sigma,\tau]\), there exists \(h\in\bC[\rho,\tau]\) with \(h(a)\succeq g(f(a))\) for
       all \(a\in\bC(\rho)\)


    We may refer to \(h\) here as a *supercomposition* of \(f\) and \(g\).
    #+END_definition

    We sometimes refer to our standard computability models as *strict* when we wish to emphasize the
    contrast with lax models. Of course, for total computability models, the distinction
    evaporates completely.

    One possible motivation for the concept of lax model is that it is often natural to think of an
    application \(f(a)\) in terms of some computational agent \(F\) representing \(f\) being placed ‘alongside’
    a representation \(A\) of a to yield a composite system \(F\mid A\), which may then evolve in certain ways
    via interactions between \(F\) and \(A\). If an agent \(G\) representing \(g\) is then placed alongside this to
    yield a system \(G\mid F\mid A\), there is the possibility that \(G\) may interact ‘directly’ with \(F\) rather
    than just with the result obtained from \(F\mid A\); thus, \(G\mid F\) might admit other behaviours not
    accounted for by \(g\circ f\) . (For a precise example of this in process algebra, see Longley
    [183].)

    The notion of a *(relative) lax TPCA* is given by replacing the axioms for \(s_{ABC}\) in
    Definition ref:3.1.16 with
    \begin{equation*}
    \forall f,g.s\cdot f\cdot g\downarrow,\quad\forall f,g,a.s\cdot f\cdot g\cdot a\succeq (f\cdot a)\cdot(g\cdot a)
    \end{equation*}

    The definitions of weak products and weak terminal may be carried over unchanged to the
    setting of lax computability models; note that \(\la f,g\ra\) is still required to be a pairing in the
    ‘strict’ sense that its domain coincides precisely with \(\dom f\cap\dom g\). The definition of weakly
    cartesian closed model is likewise unchanged, although one should note that in the lax
    setting, whether a given model is weakly cartesian closed may be sensitive to the choice of the
    type operator \(\bowtie\).

    For the definition of a lax higher-order model, we simply replace '\(\simeq\)' by '\(\succeq\)' in
    condition 4(?) of Definition ref:3.1.13

    just \(\sfT^{\to\times}(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\)

    Type worlds featuring a *unit type* (denoted by \(\texttt{1}\)) are also useful. We shall

    \sfT^{\to\times}(\texttt{1}=\{()\},\beta_0=B_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1}=B_{n-1})
    \end{equation*}
    We will often refer to the type names in a type world simply as *types*, and use \rho, \sigma, \tau to range
    over them. When dealing with formal type expressions, we adopt the usual convention that \(\to\)
    is right-associative, so that \(\rho\to\sigma\to\tau\) means \(\rho\to(\sigma\to\tau)\). For definiteness, we may also declare
    that \(\times\) is right-associative, although in practice we shall not always bother to distinguish
    between \((\rho\times\sigma)\times\tau\) and \(\rho\times(\sigma\times\tau)\). We consider \(\times\) as binding more tightly than \(\to\)

    We shall use the notation \(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{r-1}\to\tau\) as an abbreviation for \(\sigma_0\to\sigma_1\to\dots\to\sigma_{r-1}\to\tau\)
    (allowing this to mean \tau in the sense \(r=0\)). This allows us to express our intention
    regarding which objects are to be thought of as 'arguments' to a given operation: for instance,
    the types \(\ttN,\ttN,\ttN\to\ttN\) and \(\ttN,\ttN\to(\ttN\to\ttN)\) are formally the same, but in
    the first case we are thinking of a three-argument operation returning a natural number, while
    in the second we are thinking of a two-argument operation returning a function \(\N\to\N\). We also
    write \(\sigma^{(r)}\to\tau\) for the type \(\sigma,\dots,\sigma\to\tau\) with \(r\) arguments. The notation \(\sigma^r\) is

    Any type \(\sigma\in\sfT^{\to}(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\) may be uniquely written in the form \(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{r-1}\to\beta_i\)
    #+END_proposition

    We shall call this the *argument form* of \sigma. The importance of this is that it provides a useful
    induction principle for types: if a property holds for \(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{r-1}\to\beta_i\) whenever it holds
    for each of \(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{r-1}\), then it holds for all \(\sigma\in\sfT^{\to}(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\). We shall
    refer to this as *argument induction*; it is often preferable as an alternative to the usual
    *structural induction* on types

    Closely associated with argument form is the notion of the *level* of a type \sigma: informally, the
    stage at which \sigma appears in the generation of \(\sfT^\to(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\) via argument induction:
    \begin{align*}
    \lv(\beta_i)&=0\\
    \lv(\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_{r-1}\to\beta_i)&=1+\max_{i<r}\lv(\sigma_i)\quad(r\ge 1)
    \end{align*}
    When working with \(\sfT^{\to\times}(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\), it is natural to augment this definition with
    \begin{equation*}
    \lv(\sigma\times\tau)=\max(\lv(\sigma),\lv(\tau))
    \end{equation*}
    We may define the *pure type of level \(k\) over \sigma*, written \(\bark[\sigma]\):
    \begin{equation*}
    \bbar{0}[\sigma]=\sigma,\quad\ove{k+1}[\sigma]=\bark[\sigma]\to\sigma
    \end{equation*}
    For type worlds generated by a single base type \beta, we may write simply \(\bark\)
    for \(\bark[\beta]\). For instance, in the type word \(\sfT^{\to}(\N)\) we write \(\bbar{2}\) for the
    type \((\ttN\to\ttN)\to\ttN\).

    Suppose \(\bA\) is a relative partial applicative structure over \(\sfT\)
    1. The set of well-typed *applicative expressions* \(e:\sigma\) over \(\bA\) is defined inductively as
       follows
       * for each \(\sigma\in\sfT\), we have an unlimited supply of variables \(x^\sigma:\sigma\)
       * for each \(\sigma\in\sfT\) and \(a\in\bA^\sharp(\sigma)\), we have a *constant* symbol \(c_a:\sigma\) (we shall often
         write \(c_a\) simply as \(a\))
       * If \(e:\sigma\to\tau\) and \(e':\sigma\) are applicative expressions, then \(ee'\) is an applicative
         expression of type \tau.

       We write \(V(e)\) for the set of variables appearing in \(e\)

    2. A *valuation* in \(\bA\) is a function \(v\) assigning to certain variables \(x^\sigma\) an
       element \(v(x^\sigma)\in\bA^\circ(\sigma)\). Given an applicative expression \(e\) and a valuation \(v\)
       covering \(V(e)\), the value \(\llb{e}_v\), when defined, is given inductively by
       \begin{equation*}
       \llb{x^\sigma}_v=v(x),\quad\llb{c_a}_v=a,\quad\llb{ee'}_\nu\simeq\llb{e}_v\cdot\llb{e'}_v

    A (relative) partial applicative structure \(\bA\) is a lax (relative) TPCA iff it is lax
    combinatory complete
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    If \(\bA\) is lax combinatory complete, then for any \rho, \sigma, \tau we may define
    \begin{align*}
    k_{\sigma\tau}&=\llb{\lambda^*x^\sigma.(\lambda^*y^\tau.x)}_\emptyset\\
    s_{\rho\sigma\tau}&=\llb{\lambda^*x^{\rho\to\sigma\to\tau}.(\lambda^*y^{\rho\to\sigma}.(\lambda^*z^\rho.xz(yz)))}_\emptyset
    \end{align*}

    Conversely, if \(\bA\) is a lax TPCA, then given any suitable choice of elements \(k\) and \(s\)
    for \(\bA\), we may define \(\lambda^*x^\sigma.e\) by induction on the structure of \(e\):
    \begin{align*}
    \lambda^*x^\sigma.x&=s_{\sigma(\sigma\to\sigma)}k_{\sigma(\sigma\to\sigma)}k_{\sigma\sigma}&&\\
    \lambda^*x^\sigma.e&=k_{\tau\sigma}e&&\text{if }e:\tau\text{ does not contain } x\\
    \lambda^*x^\sigma.ee'&=s_{\sigma\tau\tau'}(\lambda^*x^\sigma.e)(\lambda^*x^\sigma.e')&&\text{if }e:\tau\to\tau',e':\tau\text{ and }ee'\text{ contains }x
    \end{align*}
    #+END_proof

    The same argument shows that \(\bA\) is a strict TPCA iff it is strictly combinatory complete

    we often tacitly suppose that a TPCA A comes equipped with some choice of k and s drawn from A♯,
    and in this case we shall use the notation λ∗x.e for the applicative expression given by the
    above proof. Since all the constants appearing in e are drawn from A♯, the same will be true for
    λ∗x.e.


    In TPCAs constructed as syntactic models for untyped or typed \lambda-calculi (as in Example 3.1.6 or
    Section 3.2.3), the value of \(\lambda^*x.e\) coincides with \(\lambda x.e\). However, the notational distinction is worth
    retaining, since the term \(\lambda^*x.e\) as defined above is not syntactically identical
    to \(\lambda x.e\).

    More generally, we may consider terms of the \lambda-calculus as *meta-expressions* for applicative
    expressions. Specifically any such \lambda-term \(M\) can be regarded as denoting an applicative
    expression \(M^\dagger\) as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
    x^\dag=x,\quad c_a^\dag=c_a,\quad (MN)^\dag=M^\dag N^\dag,\quad(\lambda x.M)^\dag=\lambda^*x.(M^\dag)
    \end{equation*}

    Some caution is needed here, however, because \beta-equivalent meta-expressions
    do not always have the same meaning
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_examplle
    Consider the two meta-expressions \((\lambda x.(\lambda y.y)x)\) and \(\lambda x.x\). Although these are
    \beta-equivalent, the first expands to \(s(ki)i\) and the second to \(i\), where \(i\equiv skk\).
    #+END_examplle

    The moral here is that \beta-reductions are not valid underneath \(\lambda^*\)-abstractions

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_proposition
    1. If \(M\) and \(N\) are meta-expressions where all bound variables within \(M\) are distinct
       from the free variables of \(N\) and from \(x\), then the  applicative
       expressions \(M^\dag[x\mapsto N^\dag]\) and \((M[x\mapsto N])^\dag\) are syntactically identical
    2. In this situation, \(\llb{((\lambda x.M)N)^\dag}_v\succeq\llb{M[x\mapsto N]^\dag}_v\)  for any valuation \(v\) covering
