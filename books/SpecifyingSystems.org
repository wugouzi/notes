* Liveness and Fairness

** Temporal Formulas
        * a temporal formula $F$ assigns a Boolean value, which we write $\sigma\models F$, to a behaviour
          \(\sigma\)
        * \(\sigma\models(F\wedge G)\equiv(\sigma\models F)\wedge(\sigma\models G)\)
        * \(\sigma\models\neg F\equiv\neg(\sigma\models F)\)
        * \(\sigma\models(\exists r:F)\equiv\exists r:(\sigma\models F)\)
        * \(\sigma\models(\forall r\in S:F)\equiv\forall r\in S:(\sigma\models F)\)
        * A state predicate, viewed as a temporal formula, is true of a behavior iff it is true in the first state of the behavior

A formula , where  is a state predicate, is true of a behaviour iff  is true in every state of the behaviour

A formula , where  is an action and  is a state function, is true of a behaviour iff every successive pair of steps in the behaviour is a  step ()

Let  denote the  state of the behaviour , for any natural number , so  is the behaviour

We interpret an arbitrary action  as a temporal formula by defining  to be true iff the first two states of  are an  step. That is, we define  to be true iff  is an A step. In the special case when  is a state predicate,  is an  step iff  is true in state

We have already seen that  is true of a behavior iff each step is a  step. This leads us to define  to be true iff  is an  step, for all natural numbers .

We now generalize from the definition of  for an action  to the definition of  for an arbitrary temporal formula . Let's define  to be the suffix of Ïƒ obtained by deleting its first n states:


        \begin{equation*}
        \sigma\models\Box F\equiv\forall n\in\N:\sigma^{+n}\models F
        \end{equation*}

        Example:
        \begin{align*}
        \sigma\models&\Box((x=1)\Rightarrow\Box(y>0))\\
        &\equiv\forall n\in\mathbb{N}:\sigma^{+n}\models((x=1)\Rightarrow\Box(y>0))\\
        &\equiv\forall n\in\mathbb{N}:(\sigma^{+n}\models(x=1))\Rightarrow(\sigma^{+n}\models\Box(y>0))\\
        &\equiv\forall n\in\mathbb{N}:(\sigma^{+n}\models(x=1))\Rightarrow(\forall m\in\mathbb{N}:(\sigma^{+n})^{+m}\models(y>0))\\
        \end{align*}
        To understand temporal formulas intuitively, think of \(\sigma_n\) as the state of the universe at
        time instant \(n\) during the behaviour. For any state predicate \(P\), the expression
        \(\sigma^{+n}\models P\) asserts that \(P\) is true at time \(n\). Thus
        \(\Box((x=1)\Rightarrow\Box(y>0))\) asserts that, any time \(x=1\) is true, \(y>0\) is true from then on.

        For an arbitrary temporal formula \(F\), we also interpret \(\sigma^{+n}\models F\) as the assertion
        that \(F\) is true at time instant \(n\). The formula \(\Box F\) then asserts that \(F\) is true at
        all times. We can therefore read \(\Box\) as *always* or *from then on*.
