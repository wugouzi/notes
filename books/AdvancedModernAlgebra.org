   The *15-puzzle* has a *starting position* that is a $4\times 4$ array of the
   numbers between 1 and 15 and a symbol #, which we interpret as "blank". For
   example, consider the following starting position

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :align |c|c|c|c|
   |----+----+----+----|
   |  3 | 15 |  4 |  8 |
   |----+----+----+----|

   |  2 |  5 | 13 | 12 |
   |----+----+----+----|
   |  6 |  7 | 14 |  # |
   |----+----+----+----|

   A *simple move* interchanges the blank with a symbol adjacent to it. We win the
   game if after a sequence of simple moves, the starting position is
   transformed into the standard array $1,2,\dots,15,\#$. 

   To analyze this game, note that the given array is really a permutation
   $\alpha\in S_{16}$. For example, the given starting position is
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment pmatrix
   | 1 |  2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |  6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
   | 3 | 15 | 4 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 1 | 9 | 2 |  5 | 13 | 12 |  6 |  7 | 14 | 16 |

   To win the game, we need special transpositions $\tau_1,\dots,\tau_m$ sot
   that
   \begin{equation*}
   \tau_m\dots\tau_1\alpha=(1)
   \end{equation*}

      number of transpositions
   #+END_theorem

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_corollary
   Let $\alpha,\beta\in S_n$. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the same parity, then
   $\alpha\beta$ is even while if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have distinct parity,
   $\alpha\beta$ is odd

   #+BEGIN_examplle
   An analysis of the 15-puzzle shows that if $\alpha\in S_{16}$ is the starting
   position, then the game can be won if and only if \alpha is an even permutation
   that fixes 16.

   The blank 16 starts in position 16. Each simple move takes 16 up, down, left
   or right. Thus the total number $m$ of moves is $u+d+l+r$. If 16 is to return
   home, each one of these must be undone. Thus the total number of moves is
   even: $m=2u+2r$. Hence $\alpha=\tau_1\dots\tau_m$ and so $\alpha$ is an even
   permutation. In example
   \begin{equation*}
   \alpha=(1\;3\;4\;8\;9\;2\;15\;14\;7)(5\;10)(6\;11\;13)(12)(16)
   \end{equation*}
   Now $\sgn(\alpha)=(-1)^{16-5}=-1$.

   The set $U(\I_m)$, defined by

    U(\I_m)=\{[r]\in\I_m:(r,m)=1\}

   is a multiplicative group of order $\phi(m)$. If $p$ is a prime, then
   $U(\I_p)=\I_p^{\times}$, the nonzero elements of $\I_p$.
   #+END_proposition

   $(r,m)=1=(r',m)$ implies $(rr',m)=1$. Hence $U(\I_m)$ is closed under
   multiplication. If $(x,m)=1$, then $rs+sm=1$. Therefore $(r,m)=1$. Each of

   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Assume that $p$ is a prime. If $a_1,\dots,a_n$ is a list of all the elements
   of finite abelian group, then product $a_1a_2\dots a_n$ is the same as the
   product of all elements $a$ with $a^2=1$. Since $p$ is prime, $\I_p^\times$
   has only one element of order 2, namely $[-1]$. It follows that the product
   of all the elements in $\I_p^\times$ namely $[(p-1)!]$ is equal to $[-1]$.

   Conversly assume that $m$ is composite: there are integers $a$ and $b$ with
   $m=ab$ and $1<a\le b<m$. If $a<b$ then $m=ab$ is a divisor of $(m-1)!$. If
   $a=b$, then $m=a^2$. if $a=2$, then $(a^2-1)!\equiv 2\mod 4$. If $2<a$, then
   $2a<a^2$ and so $a$ and $2a$ are factors of $(a^2-1)!$

   For the reverse inclusion, if $f([c])=([c]_m,[c]_n)\in U(\I_m)\times

   Let $G$ be a group and $H\le G$ having finite index $n$. Then there exists a
   homomorphism $\varphi:G\to S_n$ with $\ker\varphi\le H$
   #+END_theorem
  
   #+BEGIN_proof
   We still denote the family of all the cosets of $H$ in $G$ by $G/H$

   For each $a\in G$, define "translation" $\tau_a:G/H\to G/H$ by $\tau_a(xH)=axH$
   for every $x\in G$. For $a,b\in G$
   \begin{equation*}
   (\tau_a\circ\tau_b)(xH)=a(bxH)=(ab)xH
   \end{equation*}
   so that 
   \begin{equation*}
   \tau_a\tau_b=\tau_{ab}
   \end{equation*}
   It follows that each $\tau_a$ is a bijection and so $\tau_a\in S_{G/H}$. Define
   $\varphi:G\to S_{G/H}$ by $\varphi(a)=\tau_a$. Rewriting
   \begin{equation*}
   \varphi(a)\varphi(b)=\tau_a\tau_b=\tau_{ab}=\varphi(ab)
   \end{equation*}
   so that \varphi is a homomorphism. Finally if $a\in\ker\varphi$, then
   $\varphi(a)=1_{G/H}$, so that $\tau_a(xH)=xH$, in particular, when $x=1$, this
   gives $aH=H$ and $a\in H$. And $S_{G/H}\cong S_n$

   If $G$ is a group of order 6, then $G$ is isomorphic to either $\I_6$ or

   #+END_proposition

   #+BEGIN_proof

If $G$ is not cyclic, since $\abs{G}$ is even, it has some elements having
order 2, say $t$ by exercise ref:ex2.27

If $G$ is abelian. Suppose it has another different element $a$ with order 2.
Then $H=\{1,a,t,at\}$ is a subgroup which contradict. Hence it must contain
an element $b$ of order 3. Then $bt$ has order 6 and $G$ is cyclic.

If $G$ is not abelian. If $G$ doesn't have elements of order 3, then it's
abelian. Hence $G$ has an element $s$ of order 3.

Now $\abs{\la s\ra}=3$, so $[G:\la s\ra]=\abs{G}/\abs{\la s\ra}=2$ and $\la
s\ra$ is normal. 
Since $t=t^{-1}$, $tst\in\la s\ra$. If $tst=s^0=1$, $s=1$.
If $tst=s$, $\abs{\la st\ra}=6$. Therefore $tst=s^2=s^{-1}$.

Let $H=\la t\ra$, $\varphi:G\to S_{G/\la t\ra}$ given by
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(g):x\la t\ra\mapsto gx\la t\ra
\end{equation*}
By representation on cosets, $\ker\varphi\le\la t\ra$. Hence
$\ker\varphi=\{1\}$ or $\ker\varphi=\la t\ra$. Since
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(t)=
\begin{pmatrix}
\la t\ra&s\la t\ra&s^2\la t\ra\\
t\la t\ra&ts\la t\ra&ts^2\la t \ra
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
If $\varphi(t)$ is the identity permutation, then $ts\la t\ra=s\la t\ra$, so
that $s^{-1}ts\in\la t\ra=\{1,t\}$. But now $s^{-1}ts=t$. Therefore
$t\not\in\ker\varphi$ and $\ker\varphi=\{1\}$. Therefore $\varphi$ is
injective. Because $\abs{G}=\abs{S_3}$, $G\cong S_3$

   #+END_definition

   If a group $G$ acts on a set $X$, then fixing the first variable, say $g$,
   gives a function $\alpha_g:X\to X$, namely, $\alpha_g:x\mapsto gx$. This
   function is a permutation of $X$, for its inverse is $\alpha_{g^{-1}}$
   \begin{equation*}
   \alpha_g\alpha_{g^{-1}}=1=\alpha_{g^{-1}}\alpha_g
   \end{equation*}
   If's easy to see that $\alpha:G\to S_X$ defined by $\alpha:g\mapsto\alpha_g$
   is a homomorphism. Conversely, given any homomorphism $\varphi:G\to S_X$,
   define $gx=\varphi(g)(x)$. Thus an action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is
   another way of viewing a homomorphism.

   Cauchy's theorem and Fermat's theorem are special cases of some common theorem.

   If $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is a prime, define
   \begin{equation*}
   X=\{(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{p-1})\in G^p:a_0a_1\dots a_{p-1}=1\}
   \end{equation*}
   Note that $\abs{X}=\abs{G}^{p-1}$, for having chosen the last $p-1$ entries
   arbitrarily, the 0th entry must equal $(a_1a_2\dots a_{p-1})^{-1}$. Introduce an
   action of $\I_p$ on $X$ by defining, for $0\le i\le p-1$,
   \begin{equation*}
   [i](a_0,\dots,a_{p-1})=(a_{i+1},\dots,a_{p-1},a_0,\dots,a_i)
   \end{equation*}
   The product of the new \(p\)-tuple is a conjugate of $a_0a_1\dots a_{p-1}$
   \begin{equation*}
   a_{i+1}\dots a_{p-1}a_0\dots a_{i}=(a_0\dots a_i)^{-1}(a_0\dots a_{p-1})
   (a_0\dots a_i)
   \end{equation*}
   This conjugate is $1$ for $g^{-1}1g=1$, and so $[i](a_0,\dots,a_{p-1})\in X$. By
   Corollary ref:cor2.99, the size of every orbit of $X$ is a divisor of
   $\abs{\I_p}=p$. Now orbits with just one element consists of a \(p\)-tuple all
   of whose entries $a_i$ are equal, for all cyclic permutations of the \(p\)-tuple
   are the same. In other words, such an orbit corresponds to an element $a\in G$
   with $a^p=1$. Clearly $(1,1,\dots,1)$ is such an orbit; if it were the only such
   , then we would have
   \begin{equation*}
   \abs{G}^{p-1}=\abs{X}=1+kp
   \end{equation*}
   That is, $\abs{G}^{p-1}\equiv 1\mod p$. If $p$ is a divisor of $\abs{G}$, then
   we have a contradiction and thus proved Cauchy's theorem.

   Since $\la x\ra\le G$, we have $\la x\ra =G$. If $x$ has infinite order, then

   Now $Fix(\tau_i)$ is the number of 1's in the \(i\)th row. therefore 
   $\sum_{\tau\in G}Fix(\tau)$ is the total number of 1's in the array. The number
   of 1's in column 1 is $\abs{G_{x_1}}$. By Exercise ref:ex2.99
   $\abs{G_{x_1}}=\abs{G_{x_2}}$. By Theorem ref:thm2.98 the number of 1's in the
   $r$ columns labels by the $x_i\in\calo(x_i)$ is thus
   \begin{equation*}
   r\abs{G_{x_1}}=\abs{\calo(x_1)}\cdot\abs{G_{x_1}}=(\abs{G}/
   \abs{G_{x_1}})\abs{G_{x_1}}=\abs{G}

   Therefore
   \begin{equation*}
   \displaystyle\sum_{\tau\in G}Fix(\tau)=N\abs{G}

   We are going to use Burnside's lemma to solve problems of the following sort.
   How many striped flags are there having six stripes each of which can be colored
   red, white or blue?

   Let $X$ be the set of all 6-tuples of colors: if $x\in X$, then
   \begin{equation*}
   x=(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5,c_6)
   \end{equation*}

   Let \tau be the permutation that reserves all the indices:
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment pmatrix :math-prefix \tau= :math-suffix =(1\;6)(2\;5)(3\;4)
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

   (thus $\tau$ turns over each 6-tuple $x$ of colored stripes). The cyclic group
   $G=\la\tau\ra$ acts on $X$; since $\abs{G}=2$, the orbit of any 6-tuple $x$
   consists of either 1 or 2 elements. Since a flag is unchanged by turning it
   over, it is reasonable to identify a flag with an orbit of 6-tuple. For example,
   the orbit consisting of the 6-tuples
   \begin{equation*}
   (r,w,b,r,w,b)\text{ and }(b,w,r,b,w,r)
   \end{equation*}
   above. The number of flags is thus the number $N$ of orbits; by Burnside's
   lemma, $N=\frac{1}{2}[Fix((1))+Fix(\tau)]$. The identity permutation $(1)$ fixes
   every $x\in X$, and so $Fix((1))=3^6$. Now \tau fixes a 6-tuple $x$ if it's a
   "palindrome". It follows that $Fix(x)=3^3$. The number of flags is thus
   \begin{equation*}
   N=\frac{1}{2}(3^6+3^3)=378

   Assume that $k$ is a field and that \(f(x),g(x)\in k[x]\) with $f(x)\neq 0$.
   Then there are unique polynomials \(q(x),r(x)\in k[x]\) with
   \begin{equation*}
   g(x)=q(x)f(x)+r(x)
   \end{equation*}
   and either $r(x)=0$ or $\deg(r)<\deg(f)$
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   We first prove the existence of such $q$ and $r$. If \(f\mid g\), then
   \(g=qf\) for some $q$; define the remainder $r=0$. If \(f\nmid g\), then
   consider all polynomials of the form \(g-qf\) as $q$ varies over $k[x]$. The
   least integer axiom provides a polynomial \(r=g-qf\) having least degree
   among all such polynomials. Since \(g=qf+r\), it suffices to show that
   \(\deg(r)<\deg(f)\). Write \(f(x)=s_nx^n+\dots+s_1x+s_0\) and
   \(r(x)=t^mx^m+\dots t_0\). Now $s_n\neq 0$ implies that $s_n$ is a unit
   because $k$ is a field and so $s_n^{-1}\in k$. If $\deg(r)\ge\deg(f)$, define
   \begin{equation*}
   h(x)=r(x)-t_ms_n^{-1}x^{m-n}f(x)
   \end{equation*}
   that is, if \(\LT(f)=s_nx^n\), where LT abbreviates *leading term*, then
   \begin{equation*}
   h=r-\frac{\LT(r)}{\LT(f)}f
   \end{equation*}
   note that $h=0$ or \(\deg(h)<\deg(r)\). If $h=0$, then \(r=[\LT(r)/\LT(f)]f\)
   and
   \begin{align*}
   g&=qf+r=qf+\frac{\LT(r)}{\LT(f)}f\\
   &=\left[q+\frac{\LT(r)}{\LT(f)}\right]f
   \end{align*}
   contradicting \(f\nmid g\). If \(h\neq0\), then $\deg(h)<\deg(r)$ and
   \begin{equation*}
   g-qf=r=h+\frac{\LT(r)}{\LT(f)}f
   \end{equation*}
   Thus $g-[q+\LT(r)/\LT(f)]f=h$, contradicting $r$ being a polynomial of least
   degree having this form. Therefore $\deg(r)<\deg(f)$

   To prove uniqueness of $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ assume that $g=q'f+r'$, where
   $\deg(r')<\deg(f)$. Then
   \begin{equation*}
   (q-q')f=r'-r
   \end{equation*}
   If $r'\neq r$, then each side has a degree. But
   \(\deg((q-q')f)=\deg(q-q')+\deg(f)\ge\deg(f)\), while
   \(\deg(r'-r)\le\max\{\deg(r'),\deg(r)\}<\deg(f)\), a contradiction. Hence
   $r'=r$ and $(q-q')f=0$. As $k[x]$ is a domain and $f\neq 0$, it follows that
   $q-q'=0$ and $q=q'$

   If \(r_1,\dots,r_s\) where \(s\le n\) are the distinct roots of $f(x)$, then

      it is a PID, and hence it has unique factorization of its elements of into
      products of irreducibles.

      \partial is a multiplicative degree function for

      \overline{\beta}=\alpha\overline{\alpha}\beta\overline{\beta}= \partial(\alpha)\partial(\beta)
      \end{equation*}

      Let us show that \partial satisfies the second desired property. Given
      \(\alpha,\beta\in\Z[i]\) with \(\beta\neq0\), regard \(\alpha/\beta\) as an
      element of \(\C\). Rationalizing the denominator gives
      \(\alpha/\beta=\alpha\overline{\beta}/\beta\overline{\beta}=\alpha
      \overline{\beta}/\partial{\beta}\), so that
      \begin{equation*}
      a/\beta=x+yi

      where \(x,y\in\Q\). Write \(x=a+u\) and \(y=b+v\), where \(a,b\in\Z\)are
      integers closest to $x$ and $y$, respectively; thus
      \(\abs{u},\abs{v}\le1/2\). It follows that
      \begin{equation*}
      \alpha=\beta(a+bi)+\beta(u+vi)
      \end{equation*}
      Notice that \(\beta(u+vi)\in\Z[i]\). Finally we have
      \begin{equation*}
      \partial(\beta(u+vi))=\partial(\beta)\partial(u+vi)<\partial(\beta)

   If \(G=(\I_p)^\times\) is the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in
   \(\I_p\), then \(\abs{G}=p-1\equiv 0\mod 4\). By Proposition ref:prop2.78,
   $G$ contains a subgroup $S$ of order $4$. By Exercise ref:ex2.36 either $S$
   is cyclic or \(a^2=1\) for all \(a\in S\). Since \(\I_p\) is a field,
   however, it cannot contain four roots of the quadratic \(x^2-1\). Therefore,
   $S$ is cyclic, say \(S=\la[m]\ra\) where \([m]\) is the congruence class of
   $m$ mod $p$. Since \([m]\) has order 4, we have \([m^4]=[1],[m^2]\neq1\), and
   so \([m^2]=[-1]\) for \([-1]\)  is the unique element in \(S\) of order 2.

   An odd prime $p$ is a sum of two squares,
   \begin{equation*}
   p=a^2+b^2
   \end{equation*}
   where $a$ and $b$ are integers if and only if \(p\equiv 1\mod 4\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Assume that \(p=a^2+b^2\). Since $p$ is odd, $a$ and $b$ have different
   parity; say, $a$ is even and $b$ is odd. Hence \(a=2m\) and \(b=2n+1\) and
   \begin{equation*}
   p=a^2+b^2=4m^2+4n^2+4n+1\equiv1\mod 4
   \end{equation*}
   Conversely, assume that \(p\equiv1\mod4\). By the lemma, there is an integer
   $m$ s.t.
   \begin{equation*}
   p\mid(m^2+1)
   \end{equation*}
   In \(\Z[i]\), there is a factorization \(m^2+1=(m+i)(m-i)\) and so 
   \begin{equation*}
   p\mid(m+i)(m-i) \text{ in }\Z[i]
   \end{equation*}
   If \(p\mid(m\pm i)\) in \(\Z[i]\), then there are integers $u$ and $v$ with
   \(m\pm i=p(u+iv)\). Comparing the imaginary parts gives \(pv=1\), a
   contradiction. We conclude that $p$ does not satisfy the analog of Euclid's
   lemma in Theorem ref:thm3.57; it follows from Exercise ref:ex3.62 that  $p$
   is not irreducible. Hence there is a factorization
   \begin{equation*}
   p=\alpha\beta\in\Z[i]
   \end{equation*}
   Therefore, taking norms gives an equation in \(\Z\)
   \begin{align*}
   p^2&=\partial(p)=\partial(\alpha\beta)\\
   &=\partial(\alpha)\partial(\beta)=(a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)
   \end{align*}
   By Proposition ref:prop3.64, the only units in \(\Z[i]\) are \(\pm1\) and
   \(\pm i\), so that any nonzero Gaussian integers that is not a unit has a norm
   $>1$; therefore \(a^2+b^2\neq1\) and \(c^2+d^2\neq1\). Euclid's lemma now
   gives \(p\mid a^2+b^2\)  or \(p\mid c^2+d^2\); then fundamental theorem of arithmetic
   gives \(p=a^2+b^2\).

   \(\Z\), so that \(\partial(\alpha)=p\) or \(\partial(\alpha)=p^2\).
   1. \(p\equiv 3\mod4\)

      By Theorem ref:thm3.66 \(p^2=a^2+b^2\). We have \(\alpha\beta=p\) and
      \(\partial(\alpha)\partial(\beta)=\partial(p)\). Therefore, \(p^2\partial(\beta)=p^2\) and
      \(\partial(\beta)=1\). Thus \beta is a unit by Proposition ref:prop3.64 and $p$ is
      irreducible.
   2. \(p\equiv 2\mod 4\)

      \(a^2+b^2=2\)

    X'=y_n,x_1,\dots,\what{x_i},\dots,x_m

    Now repeat this argument for the spanning list

   \(k[x]/I\) is a field; \(k[x]/I\) is a domain
   #+END_proposition

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Assume \(p(x)\) is irreducible. Note that \(I=(p(x))\) is a proper ideal so
   that the /one/ in \(k[x]/I\), namely, \(1+I\) is not zero. If 
   \(f(x)+I\in k[x]/I\) is nonzero, then \(f(x)\not\in I\). Since \(p(x)\) is
   irreducible, by Lemma ref:lemma3.36, $p$ and $f$ are relatively prime. By 
   Theorem ref:thm3.31, there are polynomials \(s\) and $t$ s.t. \(1=sp+tf\).
   Thus \(tf-1\in I\) and so \(1+I=tf+I=(t+I)(f+I)\). Therefore every nonzero
   element of \(k[x]/I\) has an inverse and so \(k[x]/I\) is a field.

   If \(k[x]/I\) is a domain. If \(p(x)\) is not an irreducible polynomial. Then 
   \(p(x)=g(x)f(x)\) with \(\deg(p)> \deg(g)\), \(\deg(p)>\deg(f)\). It follows
   that \(f+I\) and \(g+I\) is nonzero but \((f+I)(g+I)=p+I\) is zero,
   contradicting to the fact that \(k[x]/I\) is a domain.

   3. If \(p(x)\nmid g(x)\), then \(p(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are relatively prime

      \(F=\F_2[x]/(q(x))\), where \(q(x)\in\F_2[x]\) is the irreducible
      polynomial \(x^2+x+1\). By Proposition ref:nprop2.141, $F$ is a field
      consisting of all \(a+b\beta\), where \(\beta=x+(q(x))\) is a root of
      \(q(x)\) and \(a,b\in\F_2\). Since \(\beta^2+\beta+1=0\), we have
      \(\beta^2=-\beta-1=\beta+1\); moreover,
      \(\beta^3=\beta\beta^2=\beta(\beta+1)=\beta^2+\beta=1\). There is a ring
      isomorphism
      \(\varphi:\F_4\to F\) with 
      \(\varphi(\begin{bsmallmatrix}a&b\\b&a+b\end{bsmallmatrix})=a+b\beta\)
   2. There are three monic irreducible quadratics in \(\F_3[x]\), namely,
      \begin{equation*}
      p(x)=x^2+1,\quad q(x)=x^2+x-1,\quad r(x)=x^2-x-1
      \end{equation*}
      each give rise to a field with \(9=3^2\) elements. Let us look at the
      first two in more detail. Proposition ref:nprop2.141 says that
      \(E=\F_3[x]/(p(x))\) is given by
      \begin{equation*}
      E=\{a+b\alpha:\text{where }\alpha^2+1=0\}
      \end{equation*}
      Similarly, if \(F=\F_3[x]/(q(x))\), then
      \begin{equation*}
      F=\{a+b\beta:\text{where }\beta^2+\beta-1=0\}
      \end{equation*}

   We now show for all prime $p$, that \(x^4+1\) factors in \(\F_p[x]\). If
   \(p=2\), then \(x^4+1=(x+1)^4\) and so we may assume that $p$ is an odd
   prime. It is easy to check that every square \(n^2\) is congruent to \(0,1\)
   or \(4\mod 8\); since $p$ is odd, we must have \(p^2\equiv1\mod8\).
   Therefore, \(\abs{(\F_{p^2})^\times}=p^2-1\) is divisible by 8. But 
   \((\F_{p^2})^\times\) is a cyclic group, by Theorem ref:nthm2.46, and so it
   has a (cyclic) subgroup of order 8, by Lemma ref:nlemma1.92. It follows that 
   \((\F_{p^2})\) contains all the 8th roots of unity; in particular,
   \(\F_{p^2}\) contains all the roots of \(x^4+1\). Hence, the splitting field
   \(E_p\) of \(x^4+1\) over \(\F_{p}\) is \(\F_{p^2}\), and so \([E_p:\F_p]=2\)
   (\(qp+r\)). Since \(x^4+1\) is irreducible in \(\F_p[x]\), then

   $p$, we have \((a+b)^p=a^p+b^p\), and so the Frobenius Fr is a homomorphism
   of fields. As any homomorphism of fields, Fr is injection; as \(\F_q\) is
   finite, Fr must be an automorphism, by the Pigeonhole principle; that is,
   \(\Fr\in G\) (Fr fixes \(\F_p\), by Fermat's Theorem)

   If \(\pi\in\F_q\) is a primitive element, then \(d(x)=\irr(\pi,\F_p)\) has
   degree $n$, by Corollary ref:ncor2.154. It suffices to prove that the order
   \(j\) of \(\Fr\) is not less than $n$. But if \(\Fr^j=1_{\F_q}\) for \(j<n\),
   then \(u^{p^j}=u\) for all of the \(q=p^n\) elements \(u\in\F_q\), giving too
   many roots of the polynomial \(x^{p^j}-x\)

    A *pure extension* of *type* $m$ is an extension field \(k(u)/k\), where
    \(u^m\in k\) for some \(m\ge1\). An extension field \(K/k\) is a *radical
    extension* if there is a tower of intermediate fields
    \begin{equation*}
    k=K_0\subseteq K_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq K_t=K
    \end{equation*}
    in which each \(K_{i+1}/K_i\) is a pure extension
    #+END_definition

    Every pure extension is a radical extension. If \(u^m=a\in k\), then
    \(k(u)\) arises from $k$ by adjoining an \(m\)th root of \(a\). If
    \(k\subseteq\C\), there are $m$ different \(m\)th roots of $a$, namely,
    \(u,\omega u,\dots,\omega^{m-1}u\), where \(\omega=e^{2\pi i/m}\) is a primitive

       \(x^n-1\) is \(E=k(\omega)\)
    2. Let $p$ be a prime and let $k$ contain all \(p\)th roots of unity. If

     \begin{equation*}
     \frac{1}{2}(-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4c})
     \end{equation*}
     Let \(k=\Q(b,c)\). Define \(K_1=k(u)\), where \(u=\sqrt{b^2-c}\). Then
     \(K_1\) is a radical extension of $k$, for \(u^2\in k\). Moreover, the
     quadratic formula implies that \(K_1\) is the splitting field of \(f(x)\),
     and so \(f(x)\) is solvable by radicals
**** Cubics
     Let \(f(X)=X^3+bX^2+cX+d\), and let \(k=\Q(b,c,d)\). Change of variable
     \(X=x-b/3\) yields a new polynomial: \(\widetilde{f}(x)=x^3+qx+r\in k[x]\)
     having the same splitting field $E$; it follows that \(\widetilde{f}(x)\)
     is solvable by radicals if and only if \(f(x)\) is. The cubic formula gives
     the roots of \(\widetilde{f}(x)\) as
     \begin{equation*}
     g+h,\quad,\omega g+\omega^2h,\quad w^2g+\omega h
     \end{equation*}
     where \(g^3=\frac{1}{2}(-r+\sqrt{R})\), \(h=-q/3g\),
     \(R=r^2+\frac{4}{27}q^3\), and \omega is a primitive cube root of unity.

     Define \(K_1=k(\sqrt{R})\), \(K_2=K_1(\alpha)\), where
     \(\alpha^3=\frac{1}{2}(-r+\sqrt{R})\). \(K_2\) contains the root

    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    1. By Theorem ref:nthm2.144, there are irreducible polynomials 
       \(p_i(x)=\irr(u_i,k)\in k[x]\). Define $E$ to be a splitting field of 
       \(f(x)=p_1(x)\dots p_t(x)\) over $k$. Since \(u_i\in E\) for all $i$, we
       have \(B=k(u_1,\dots,u_t)\subseteq E\). If each \(u_i\) is separable over
       $k$, then each \(p_i(x)\) is a separable polynomial, and hence \(f(x)\)
       is a separable polynomial.

       For each pair of roots \(u\) and \(u'\) of any \(p_i(x)\), Theorem
       ref:nthm2.144 gives an isomorphism \(\gamma:k(u)\to k(u')\). By Lemma
       ref:nlemma2.156, each such \gamma extends to an automorphism
       \(\sigma\in G=\Gal(E/k)\). Thus \(f(x)\) splits over 
       \(k(\sigma(u_1),\dots,\sigma(u_t):\sigma\in G)\). But \(E/k\) is a splitting field
       of \(f(x)\) over \(k\) and \(k(\sigma(u_1),\dots,\sigma(u_t):\sigma\in G)\subseteq E\); hence,
       \begin{equation*}
       E=k(\sigma(u_1),\dots,\sigma(u_t):\sigma\in G)
       \end{equation*}
       because a splitting field is the smallest field over which \(f(x)\) splits

    2. Assume now that \(B/k\)is a radical extension; say,
       \(B=k(v_1,\dots,v_s)\), where 
       \begin{equation*}
       k\subseteq k(v_1)\subseteq k(v_1,v_2)\subseteq\dots\subseteq k(v_1,\dots,v_s)=B
       \end{equation*}
       and each \(k(v_1,\dots,v_{i+1})/k(v_1,\dots,v_i)\) is a pure extension;
       of course, \(\sigma(B)=k(\sigma(v_1),\dots,\sigma(v_s))\) is a radical extension of $k$
       for every \(\sigma\in G\). Define 
       \begin{equation*}
       B_1=k(\sigma(v_1):\sigma\in G)
       \end{equation*}
       Now if \(G=\{1,\sigma,\tau,\dots\}\), then the tower
       \begin{equation*}
       k\subseteq k(v_1)\subseteq k(v_1,\sigma(v_1))\subseteq
       k(v_1,\sigma(v_1),\tau(v_1))\subseteq\dots\subseteq B_1
       \end{equation*}
       displays $B_1$ as a radical extension of $k$. If \(v_1^m\in k\), 
       \(\tau(v_1)^m=\tau(v_1^m)\) lies in \(\tau(k)=k\). Define
       \begin{equation*}
       B_{i+1}=B_i(\sigma(v_{i+1}):\sigma\in G)
       \end{equation*}
       Assume, by induction, that \(B_i/k\) is a radical extension and that 
       \(\sigma(B_i)\subseteq B_i\) for all \(\sigma\in G\). Now \(B_{i+1}/B_i\) is a

    splitting field of \(x^m-1\) over $E$, and define \(k^*=k(\Omega)\), where \Omega is
    the set of all \(m\)th roots of unity in \(E^*\). Now \(E^*/k^*\) is a
    normal extension, for it is a splitting field of \(f(x)\) over \(k^*\), and
    so \(\Gal(E^*/k^*)\) is solvable, by Lemma ref:nlemma3.21 and Proposition
    ref:nprop3.22. Consider the tower \(k\subseteq k^*\subseteq E^*\)
    \begin{center}

    \node (1) at (0,0) {$E$};
    \node (2) at (0,-1) {$k$};

    Since \(k^*/k\) is normal, Theorem ref:nthm3.17 gives
    \(\Gal(E^*/k^*)\tril\Gal(E^*/k)\) and 
    \begin{equation*}
    \Gal(E^*/k)/\Gal(E^*/k^*)\cong\Gal(k^*/k)
    \end{equation*}
    Now\(\Gal(E^*/k^*)\) is solvable, while \(\Gal(k^*/k)\) is abelian, hence
    solvable, by Proposition ref:nprop3.12. Finally, we may use Theorem
    ref:nthm3.17 once again, for the tower \(k\subseteq E\subseteq E^*\)
    satisfies the hypothesis that both \(E\) and \(E^*\) are normal. It follows
    that \(\Gal(E^*/k)/\Gal(E^*/E)\cong\Gal(E/k)\), and so \(G/k\), being a
    quotient of a solvable group, is solvable

    over $F$.

    We claim that \(\Gal(E/F)\cong S_n\). Now if \(\sigma\in S_n\), then there
    is an automorphism \(\widetilde{\sigma}\) of \(k[y_1,\dots,y_n]\), defined by 
    \(\widetilde{\sigma}:f(y_1,\dots,y_n)\mapsto f(y_{\sigma 1},\dots,y_{\sigma n})\). Thus
    \(\widetilde{\sigma}\) extends to an automorphism \(\sigma^*\) of 
    \(E=\Frac(k[y_1,\dots,y_n])\) and \(\sigma^*\) fixes $F$; hence
    \(\sigma^*\in\Gal(E/F)\). Since \(\sigma\mapsto\sigma^*\) is an injection, 
    \(\abs{S_n}\le\abs{\Gal(E/F)}\).

   If $I$ is a proper ideal in a commutative ring $R$, then there is an
   inclusion-preserving bijection \varphi from the set of all intermediate ideals $J$
   containing $I$, that is, \(I\subseteq J\subseteq R\), to the set of all the
   ideals in $R/I$, given by

   If we forget its multiplication, the commutative ring $R$ is merely an
   additive group and its ideal is a (normal) subgroup. Theorem ref:thm2.76
   gives an inclusion-preserving bijection
   \begin{equation*}
   \Phi:\{\text{all subgroups of $R$ containing $I$}\}\to 
   \{\text{all subgroups of $R/I$}\}

   If $J$ is an ideal, then \(\Phi(J)\) is also an ideal.

   We show first, by induction on \(\deg(f)\), that every \(f(x)\in R[x]\),

   \(f(x)=c(f)f^*(x)\) where \(c(f)\in R\) and \(f^*(x)\) is primitive. If

   neither $g$ nor $h$ is a unit. And so each is is a product of irreducibles,
   by the inductive hypothesis

   Now Proposition ref:prop6.17 applies: \(R[x]\) is a UFD if \((p(x))\) is a
   prime ideal for every irreducible \(p(x)\in R[x]\). Let's assume 
   \(p\mid fg\) and \(p\nmid f\)

   \begin{equation*}
   f(x)=c(f)f^*(x),\quad g(x)=c(g)g^*(x)

   Now \(p\mid fg\), so that
   \begin{equation*}
   p\mid c(f)c(g)f^*(x)g^*(x)
   \end{equation*}
   Since \(f^*(x)g^*(x)\) is primitive, Lemma ref:lemma6.24 says that
   \(c(f)c(g)\) is an associate of \(c(fg)\). However, if \(p\mid fg\), then $p$
   divides each coefficient of \(fg\); that is, $p$ is a common divisor of all
   coefficients of $fg$, and hence in $R$, which is a UFD, $p$ divides the
   associates \(c(fg)\) and \(c(f)c(g)\). But Proposition ref:prop6.17 says that
   \((p)\) is a prime ideal, and so \(p\mid c(f)\) or \(p\mid c(g)\). Therefore
   \(p\mid c(g)\)

   Case (ii). Suppose that \(\deg(p)>0\). Let 
   \begin{equation*}
   (p,f)=\{s(x)p(x)+t(x)f(x):s(x),t(x)\in R[x]\}
   \end{equation*}
   Choose \(m(x)\in(p,f)\) of minimal degree. If \(Q=\Frac(R)\) is the fraction
   field of $R$, then the division algorithm in \(Q[x]\) gives polynomials

   where either \(r'(x)=0\) or \(\deg(r')<\deg(m)\). Clearing denominators,
   there are polynomials \(q(x),r(x)\in R[x]\) and a constant \(b\in R\) with

   bf(x)=q(x)m(x)+r(x)
   \end{equation*}
   Since \(m\in(p,f)\), there are polynomials \(s(x),t(x)\in R[x]\) with 
   \(m=sp+tx\); hence \(r=bf-qm\in(b,f)\). Since \(m\) has minimal degree, we
   must have \(r=0\); that is, \(bf(x)=q(x)m(x)\), and so
   \(bf(x)=c(m)m*(x)q(x)\). So that \(m^*(x)\mid f(x)\) by Lemma ref:lemma6.24.
   A similar argument, replacing \(f(x)\) by \(p(x)\), gives 
   \(m^*(x)\mid p(x)\). If \(m^*(x)\) were an associate of \(p(x)\), then
   \(p(x)\mid f(x)\), contrary to hypothesis. Hence \(m^*(x)\) is a unit; that
   is, \(m(x)=c(m)\in R\), and so \(p,f\) contains the nonzero constant
   \(c(m)\). Now \(c(m)=sp+tf\), and so
   \begin{equation*}
   c(m)g(x)=s(x)p(x)g(x)+t(x)f(x)g(x)
   \end{equation*}
   Since \(p\mid fg\), we have \(p(x)\mid c(m)g(x)\). But \(p(x)\) is primitive, 
   \(p(x)\mid g(x)\)

   The ring of real numbers \(\R\) is a vector space over $\Q$; a basis is
   usually called a *Hamel basis*, and it is useful in constructing analytic
   counterexamples. For example, we may use a Hamel basis to prove the existence
   of a discontinuous function \(f:\R\to\R\) that satisfies the functional
   equation \(f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)\).

   As in the finite-dimensional case, if \(B\) is a basis of a vector space $V$,
   then any function \(f:B\to V\) extends to a linear transformation \(F:V\to
   V\). A Hamel basis has cardinal \(c=\abs{\R}\), and so there are
   \(c^c=2^c>c\) functions \(f:\R\to\R\) satisfying the functional equation, for
   every linear transformation is additive. On the other hand, every continuous
   function on $\R$ is determined by its values on \(\Q\), which is countable.

   Let \(x\in\R\), then there is a sequence of rational numbers
   \((q_n)_{n=1}^\infty\) that converges to $x$. Continuity of $f$ means that
   \begin{equation*}
   \lim_{n\to\infty}f(q_n)=f(\lim_{n\to\infty}q_n)=f(x)
   \end{equation*}
   This means that the values of $f$ at rational numbers already determine $f$.
   In other words, the mapping \(\Phi:C(\R,\R)\to\R^\Q\), defined by
   \(\Phi(f)=f_{\Q}\), where \(f|_\Q:\Q\to\R\) is the restriction of $f$ to $\Q$ is

   2. Vector spaces \(V\) and \(V'\) over $k$ are isomorphic if and only if 
      \(\dim(V)=\dim(V')\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   1. Let $B$ and $B'$ be bases of $V$. We may assume $B$ and $B'$ are infinite.

      Each \(v\in V\) has a unique expression of the form 
      \(v=\sum_{b\in B}\alpha_bb\), where \(\alpha_b\in k\) and almost all
      \(\alpha_b=0\)(the rule only allows finite operation)
      . Define the *support*
      of $v$ (w.r.t. $B$) by
      \begin{equation*}
      \supp(v)=\{b\in B:\alpha_b\neq0\}
      \end{equation*}
      thus \(\supp(v)\) is a finite subset of $B$ for every \(v\in V\). Define 
      \(f:B'\to\Fin(B)\) by \(f(b')=\supp(b)\). Note that if 
      \(\supp(b')=\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}\), then \(b'\in\la
      b_1,\dots,b_n\ra=\la\supp(b')\ra\). Since \(\la\supp(b')\ra\) has
      dimension $n$, it contains at most $n$ elements of $B'$, because $B'$ is
      independent. Therefore \(f^{-1}(T)\) is finite for every finite subset
      subset \(T\) of $B$. By Lemma ref:fact1, we have
      \(\abs{B'}\le\abs{\Fin(B)}\), and by Lemma ref:fact2, we have
      \(\abs{B'}\le\abs{B}\). Interchanging the roles of $B$ and $B'$ gives the
      reverse inequality, and so Lemma ref:fact3 gives \(\abs{B}=\abs{B'}\).

   Let \(\calf\) be the family of all ideals in $R$ that are not finitely

   that is not finitely generated and that is maximal.

   Suppose \(ab\in I\) but \(a\not\in I\) and \(b\not\in I\). 
   \(I\subsetneq I+Ra\) and \(I_Ra\) is finitely generated; we may assume that 
   \begin{equation*}
   I+Ra=(i_1+r_1a,\dots,i_n+r_na)
   \end{equation*}
   where \(i_k\in I\) and \(r_k\in R\). Consider \(J=(I:a)=\{x\in R:xa\in I\}\). 
   Now \(I+Rb\subseteq J\) and hence $J$ is finitely generated. We claim that 
   \(I=(i_1,\dots,i_n,Ja)\). Clearly \((i_1,\dots,i_n,Ja)\subseteq I\). If
   \(z\in I\subseteq I+Ra\), there are \(u_k\in R\) with

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let $T$ be a set in bijective correspondence with the family of nonconstant
   polynomials in \(k[x]\). Let \(R=k[T]\) be the big polynomial ring, and let
   $I$ be the ideal in $R$ generated by all elements of the form \(f(t_f)\),
   where \(t_f\in T\)

   We claim that the ideal $I$ is proper; if not, \(1\in I\), and there are
   distinct \(t_1,\dots,t_n\in T\) and polynomials \(h_1(T),\dots,h_n(T)\in
   k[T]\) with \(1=h_1(T)f_1(T)+\dots+h_n(T)f_n(t_n)\), contradicting Lemma
   ref:nlemma5.56. Therefore there is a maximal ideal $M$ in $R$ containing $I$
   by Theorem ref:nthm5.43. Define \(K=R/M\). The proofs is now completed in a
   series of steps
   1. \(K/k\) is a field extension

      Because $M$ is maximal, \(R=(a)+M\) for any \(a\not\in M\). So \(1=ra+m\)
      or equivalently \(1+M=(r+M)(a+M)\). So \(K=R/M\) is a field. Let 
      \(i:k\to k[T]\) be the ring map taking \(a\in k\) to the constant
      polynomial $a$, and let \theta be the composite 
      \(k\xrightarrow{i}k[T]=R\xrightarrow{\text{nat}}R/M=K\). Now \theta is injective
      by Corollary ref:ncor2.32. We identify $k$ with \(\im\theta\subseteq K\)

   2. Every nonconstant \(f(x)\in k[x]\) splits in \(K[x]\)

      By definition, there is \(t_f\in T\) with \(f(t_f)\in I\subseteq M\), and
      the coset \(t_f+M\in R/M=K\) is a root of \(f(x)\). It now follows by
      induction on degree that \(f(x)\) splits over $K$

   3. The extension \(K/k\) is algebraic

      By Lemma ref:nlemma5.55, it suffices to show that each \(t_f+M\) is
      algebraic over $k$ (for $K=k(\text{all }t_f+M)$ follows from
      ref:prop3.117)

      
   Let \(k_1=K\) and construct \(k_{n+1}\) from $k$ in the same way $K$ is
   constructed from $k$. There is a tower of fields 
   \(k=k_0\subseteq k_1\subseteq \dots\subseteq k_n\subseteq\dots\) with each
   extension \(k_{n+1}/k_n\) algebraic and with every nonconstant polynomials in
   \(k_n[x]\) having a root in \(k_{n+1}\). By Lemma ref:nlemma5.55
   \(E=\bigcup_nk_n\)is an algebraic extension of $k$. We claim that $E$ is

   In the following diagram, all arrows other than $f$ are inclusions

   k \arrow[u,"i"]\arrow[r]&E\arrow[ul,"f"']\arrow[r]&F

   Define \(X=\{\text{approximations }(E,f):k\subseteq E\subseteq F\}\). Note that
   \(X\neq\emptyset\) because \((k,i)\in X\). Partially order $X$ by
   \begin{equation*}
   (E,f)\preceq(E',f')\text{ if }E\subseteq E'\text{ and }f|E'=f
   \end{equation*}

   Chain
   \begin{equation*}
   \cals=\{(E_j,f_j):j\in J\}
   \end{equation*}
   has an upper bound \((\bigcup E_j,\bigcup f_j=\Phi)\). \Phi is a \(k\)-map

   By Zorn's Lemma, there exists a maximal element \((E_0,f_0)\) in $X$. We
   claim that \(E_0=F\) and this will complete the proof (take \(\psi=f_0\)).
   If \(E_0\subsetneq F\), then there is \(a\in F\) with \(a\not\in E_0\). Since
   \(F/k\) is algebraic, we have \(F/E_0\) algebraic, and there is an
   irreducible \(p(x)\in E_0[x]\) having $a$ as a root. Since \(\bar{k}/k\) is
   algebraic and \(\bar{k}\) is algebraically closed, we have a factorization
   in \(\bar{k}[x]\):
   \begin{equation*}
   f_0^*(p(x))=\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)
   \end{equation*}
   where \(f_0^*:E_0[x]\to\bar{k}[x]\) is the map
   \(f_0^*:e_0+\dots+e_nx^n\mapsto f_0(e_0)+\dots+f_0(e_n)x^n\). If all the
   \(b_i\) lie in \(f_0(E_0)\subseteq\bar{k}\), then
   \(f_0^{-1}(b_i)\in E_0\subseteq F\) for all $i$, and there is a factorization
   of \(p(x)\) in \(F[x]\), namely, \(p(x)=\prod_{i=1}^n[x-f_0^{-1}(b_i)]\). But
   \(a\not\in E_0\) implies \(a\neq f_0^{-1}(b_i)\) for all $i$. Thus \(x-a\) is
   another factor of \(p(x)\) in \(F[x]\), _contrary to unique factorization._
   . We conclude that there is some \(b_i\not\in\im f_0\). By Theorem
   ref:nthm2.144, we may define \(f_1:E_0(a)\to\bar{k}\) by
   \begin{equation*}
    c_0+c_1a+c_2a^2+\cdots\mapsto f_0(c_0)+f_0(c_1)b_i+\dots
   \end{equation*}
   A straight forward check shows that \(f_1\) is a \(k\)-map extending \(f_0\).
   Hence \((E_0,f_0)\prec(E_0(a),f_1)\), contradicting the maximality of \((E_0,f_0)\).

   \begin{equation*}
   \deg(\theta(y))=\deg(g(y)-\varphi h(y))=\max\{\deg(g),\deg(h)\}=\degree(\varphi)

   Now \(x\) is a root of \(\theta(y)\), so that \(x\) is algebraic over \(k(\varphi)\).
   Were \varphi algebraic over $k$, then \(k(\varphi)/k\) would be finite, giving

   \(f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) with \(f(u_1,\dots,u_n)=0\). A field

   Let \(E/k\) be a field extension, let \(u_1,\dots,u_n\in E\) and let 
   \(\varphi:k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to E\) be the evaluation map
   \(f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\mapsto f(u_1,\dots,u_n)\). Now
   \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\)is algebraically dependent if and only if \(\ker\varphi\neq\{0\}\).
   If \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\) is algebraically independent, then \varphi extends to an

   In particular, if \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\) is algebraically independent and

   Let \(E/k\) be a field extension. Then \(U\subseteq E\) is algebraically
   dependent over $k$ if and only if there is \(v\in U\) with $v$ algebraic
   over \(k(U-\{v\})\)
   #+END_proposition

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If $U$ is algebraically dependent over $k$, then there is a finite
   algebraically dependent subset \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\subseteq U\); thus, we may
   assume that \(U\) is finite. We prove, by induction on \(n\ge1\), that some
   \(u_i\) is algebraic over \(k(U-\{u_i\})\). If \(n=1\), it's obvious.

   Let \(U=\{u_1,\dots,u_{n+1}\}\) be algebraically dependent. We may assume
   that \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\) is algebraically independent. Since $U$ is
   algebraically dependent, there is a nonzero 
   \(f(X,y)\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y]\) with \(f(u_1,\dots,u_n,u_{n+1}=0)\), where
   \(X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) and $y$ is a new variable. We may write 
   \(f(X,y)=\sum_ig_i(X)y^i\), where \(g_i(X)\in k[X]\).Since \(f(X,y)\neq0\),
   some \(g_i(X)\neq0\), and it follows from algebraic independence of
   \(\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\) that \(g_i(u_1,\dots,u_n)\neq0\). Therefore,
   \(h(y)=\sum_ig(u_1,\dots,u_n)y^i\in k(U)[y]\). But \(0=h(u_{n+1})\), so that
   \(u_{n+1}\) is algebraic over \(k(u_1,\dots,u_n)\)

   For the converse, assume that $v$ is algebraic over \(k(U-\{v\})\). We may
   assume that \(U-\{v\}\) is finite, say, \(U-\{v\}=\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\), where
   \(n\ge0\). We prove by induction on \(n\ge0\). For the inductive step, let 
   \(U-\{u_{n+1}\}=\{u_1,\dots,u_n\}\) and assume it is algebraically
   independent. By hypothesis, there is a nonzero polynomial 
   \(f(y)=\sum_ic_iy^i\in k(u_1,\dots,u_n)[y]\) with \(f(u_{n+1})=0\). As
   \(f(y)\neq0\), we may assume that at least one of its coefficients is
   nonzero. For all $i$, the coefficient \(c_i\in k(u_1,\dots,u_n)\), so there
   are rational functions \(c_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) with
   \(c_i(u_1,\dots,u_n)=c_i\) [because 
   \(k(u_1,\dots,u_n)\cong k(x_1,\dots,x_n)\)]

   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If \(u\preceq S\), then $u$ is algebraic over \(k(S)\); that is, 
   \(u\in(E/k(S))_{\alg}=\{e\in E:e\text{ is algebraic over }k(S)\}\). Suppose
   there is some \(T\subseteq E\) with \(s\preceq T\) for every \(s\in S\); that
   is, \(S\subseteq(E/k(T))_{\alg}\). It follows from Lemma ref:nlemma5.55 that 
   \((E/k(S))_{\alg}\subseteq(E/k(T))_{\alg}\); and so \(u\preceq T\)

   The Exchange Axiom assumes that \(u\preceq S\) and $u$ is transcendental over
   \(k(S-\{v\})\). Note that \(v\in S\) and \(u\not\in S\). Let us apply
   Proposition ref:nprop5.66 to the subsets \(U'=\{u,v\}\) and \(S'=S-\{v\}\) of
   $E$ and the subfield \(k'=k(S')\). With this notation,
   \(k'(U'-\{u\})=k'(v)=k(S',v)=k(S)\), so that $u$ is algebraic over \(k(S)\)
   can be restated as \(u\)  algebraic over \(k'(U'-\{u\})\). Thus Proposition
   ref:nprop5.66 says that \(U'=\{u,v\}\) is algebraically dependent over
   \(k'=k(S)\): there is a nonzero polynomial \(f(x,y)\in k(S')[x,y]\) with

   1. Since the empty set \(\emptyset\) is independent, the second statement

      We use Zorn's Lemma to prove the existence of maximal independent subsets

      \Omega containing $B$. $X$ is nonempty. Suppose that \(\calb=(B_j)_{j\in J}\)
      is a chain in $X$. It is clear that \(B^*=\bigcup_{j\in J}B_j\) is an
      upper bound of $\calb$ if it lies in $X$. If \(B^*\) is dependent, then
      there is \(y\in B^*\) with \(y\preceq B^*-\{y\}\). By _Dependency Axiom

      \(\abs{B}=\abs{C}\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If \(B=\emptyset\), we claim that \(C=\emptyset\). Otherwise there exists
   \(y\in C\), and since \(C\) is independent, \(y\not\preceq C-\{y\}\). But
   \(y\preceq B=\emptyset\) and \(\emptyset\subseteq C-\{y\}\), so that 
   _Dependency Axiom (3)_ \(y\preceq C-\{y\}\), a contradiction.

   Now assume \(B\) is finite; say, \(B=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\). We prove, by
   induction on \(k\ge0\), that there exists 
   \(\{y_1,\dots,y_{k-1}\subseteq C\}\) with
   \begin{equation*}
   B_k=\{y_1,\dots,y_{k-1},x_k,\dots,x_n\}
   \end{equation*}
   a basis; that is , the elements \(x_1,\dots,x_{k-1}\) can be exchanged with
   elements \(y_1,\dots,y_{k-1}\in C\) so that \(B_k\) is a basis.

   Assume \(B_k=\{y_1,\dots,y_{k-1},x_k,\dots,x_n\}\) is a basis, we want to
   show that \(B_{k+1}\) is basis. We claim that there is \(y_k\in C\) with 
   \(y_k\not\preceq B_k-\{x_k\}\). Otherwise, \(y\preceq B_k-\{x_k\}\) for all 
   \(y\preceq C\). But \(x_k\preceq C\), and so _Dependency Axiom (3)_ gives 
   \(x_k\preceq B_k-\{x_k\}\).

   By Lemma ref:nlemma5.69, \(B_{k+1}\) is independent. To see that \(B_{k+1}\)
   is a basis, it suffices to show that it generates \Omega. Now 
   \(y_k\preceq B_k\) and \(y_k\not\preceq B_k-\{x_k\}\); the Exchange Axiom
   gives
   \(x_k\preceq (B_k-\{x_k\}\cup\{y_k\})=B_{k+1}\)

   If \(\abs{C}>n=\abs{B}\). Then \(B_n\subseteq C\). Thus a proper subset of
   $C$ generates \Omega, contradicting the independence of $C$
