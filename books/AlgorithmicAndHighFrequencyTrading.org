* Electronic Markets and the Limit Order Book
** Electronic markets and how they function
        *Shares* are claims of ownership on corporations. These claims are used by corporations to raise money.
        In the US, for these shares to be traded in an electronic exchange they have to be 'listed' by an
        exchange, and this implies fulfilling certain requirements in terms of the number of shareholders,
        price, etc. The listing process is usually tied to the first issuance of the public shares (initial
        public offering, or IPO). The fundamental value of these shares is derived from the nature of the
        contract it represents. In its simplest form, it is a claim of ownership on the company that gives the
        owner the right to receive an equal share of the corporation's profits (hence the name, 'share') and
        to intervene in the corporate decision process via the right to vote in the corporation's annual
        general (shareholders') meetings. Such shares are called *ordinary shares* (or *common stock*) and are the
        most common type of shares.

        The other primary instrument used by large corporations to raise capital is *bonds*. Bonds are contracts
        by which the corporation commits to paying the holder a regular income (interest) but gives them no
        decision rights. The differences between stocks and bonds are quite clear: shareholders have no
        guarantees on the magnitude and frequency of dividends but have voting rights, bondholders have
        guarantees of regular, pre-determined payments and no voting rights.

        There are other instruments with characteristics from both these contracts, the most familiar of which
        is *preferred stock*. Preferred stock represents a hybrid of stocks and bonds: they are like bonds in
        that holders have no voting rights and receive a pre-arranged income, but the income they receive has
        fewer guarantees: its legal treatment is that of equity, rather than debt. This difference is
        especially relevant when the corporation is in financial distress, as debt is senior to all equity, so
        that in case of liquidation, debt holders' claims have priority over the corporation's assets -they
        get paid first. Equity holders, if they get paid, are paid only after all debtholders' claims are
        settled.

        A *mutual fund* is an investment product that acts as a delegated investment manager. That is, when an
        investor buys a mutual fund, the investor gives her cash to a financial management company that will
        use the cash to build a portfolio of assets according to the fund's investment objective. This
        objective includes the fund's assets and investment strategy, and, of course, its management fees. The
        fund's assets can belong to a large number of possible asset classes, including all those described
        above: equities, bonds, cash, FX, real estate, etc. The fund's investment strategy refers to the style
        of investment, primarily whether the fund is actively managed or passively tracks an index.

        An investor who puts money in a fund participates in both the appreciation and depreciation of the
        assets as allocated by the fund manager. In order to redeem her investment, i.e. to convert her
        investment into cash, the investor's options depend on the type of fund she purchased. There are two
        main types of mutual funds: *open-end* and *closed-end* funds. Closed-end funds are mutual funds that are
        not redeemable: the fund issues a fixed number of shares usually only once, at inception, and
        investors cannot sell the shares back to the fund. The fund sells the shares initially through an IPO
        and these shares are listed on an exchange where investors buy and sell these shares to each other.

        Open-end funds are funds with a varying number of shares. Shares can be created to meet the demand of
        new investors, or destroyed (bought back by the fund) as investors seek to redeem theirs. This process
        takes place once a day, as the value of the fund's (net) assets (its Net Asset Value, NAV) is
        determined after the market close. Thus, closed-end funds, that do not have to adjust their holdings
        in response to investor demand, have different liquidity requirements than open-end funds and thus may
        trade at prices different from their NAV.

        A very popular type of fund that, like closed-end funds, are traded in electronic exchanges, are ETFs.
        Like mutual funds, ETFs act as delegated investment managers, but they differ in two key respects.
        First, ETFs tend to have very specific investment strategies, usually geared towards generating the
        same return as a particular market index (e.g., the S&P500). Second, they are not obligated to
        purchase investors' shares back. Rather, if an investor wants to return their share to the fund, the
        fund can transfer to the investor a basket of securities that mirrors that of the ETF. This is
        possible because the ETF sells shares in very large units (Creation Units) which are then broken up
        and resold as individual shares in the exchange. A Creation Unit can be as large as 50,000 shares.
        Overall, the general perception one gets is that investors who are looking to reduce their trading
        costs and find diversified investments prefer ETFs, while investors who are looking for managers with
        stock-picking or similar unusual skills and who aim to beat the market will prefer mutual funds.

        Some investment firms feel that the regulation that is imposed on mutual fund managers to ensure they
        fulfill their fiduciary duties to investors are too constraining. In response to this they have
        created *hedge-funds*, funds that pursue more aggressive trading strategies and have fewer regulatory
        and transparency requirements. Because of the softer regulatory oversight, access to these investment
        vehicles is largely limited to accredited investors, who are expected to be better informed and able
        to deal with the fund's managers. Although these funds are not traded on exchanges, their managers are
        active participants in those markets.

        There are also other securities traded in electronic exchanges; in particular, there is a great deal
        of electronic trading in derivative markets, especially futures, swaps and options, and these
        contracts are written on a wide variety of assets (bonds, FX, commodities, equities, indices). The
        concepts and techniques we develop in this book apply to the trading of any of these assets, although
        we primarily focus our examples and applications on equities. However, when designing algorithms and
        strategies one must always take into account the specific issues associated with the types of assets
        one is trading in, as well as the specifics of the particular electronic exchange(s) and the trading
        objectives of other investors one is likely to meet there.
** Classifying Market Participants
        Three primary classes of traders (or trading strategies) below.
        1. *Fundamental* (or *noise* or liquidity ) *traders*: those who are driven by economic fundamentals outside the exchange.
        2. *Informed traders*: traders who profit from leveraging information not reflected in market prices by
           trading assets in anticipation of their appreciation or depreciation.
        3. *Market makers*: professional traders who profit from facilitating exchange in a particular asset and
           exploit their skills in executing trades.
** Trading in Electronic Markets
*** Orders and the Exchange
        In the basic setup, an electronic market has two types of orders: *Market Orders* (MOs), and *Limit
        Orders* (LOs).
        * MOs are usually considered aggressive orders that seek to execute a trade immediately. By sending an
          MO, a trader indicates that she wants to buy or sell a certain quantity of shares at the best
          available price, and this will (usually ) result in an immediate trade (execution).
        * On the other hand, LOs are considered passive orders, as a trader sending in an LO indicates her
          desire to buy or sell at a given price up to a certain, maximum, quantity of shares. As the price
          offered in the LO is usually worse than the current market price (higher than the best buy price for
          sell LOs, and lower than the best sell price for buy LOs), it will not result in an immediate trade,
          and will thus have to wait until either it is matched with a new order that wants to trade at the
          offered price (and executed) or it is withdrawn (cancelled).

        Orders are managed by a matching engine and a limit order book (LOB). The LOB keeps track of incoming
        and outgoing orders. The matching engine uses a well-defined algorithm that establishes when a
        possible trade can occur, and if so, which criterion is going to be used to select the orders that
        will be executed. Most markets prioritise MOs over LOs and then use a price-time priority whereby, if
        an MO to buy comes in, the buy order will be matched with the standing LOs to sell in the following
        way:
        1. the incoming order will be matched with the LOs that offer the best price (for buy orders, the sell
           LOs with the lowest price)
        2. if the quantity demanded is less than what is on offer at the best price, the matching algorithm
           selects the oldest LOs, the ones that were posted earliest, and executes them in order until the
           quantity of the MO is executed completely.
        3. If the MO demands more quantity than that offered at the best price, after executing all standing
           LOs at the best price, the matching algorithm will proceed by executing against the LOs at the
           second-best price, then the third-best and so on until the whole order is executed.

        LOs that have increasingly worse prices are referred to as LOs that are deeper in the LOB, and the
        process whereby an entering market order executes against standing LOs deeper in the LOB is called
        'walking the book'.

        Figure [[ref:f1.1]] shows a snapshot of the limit order book (LOB) on NASDAQ after the 10,000th event
        of the day for two stocks, FARO and HPQ, on Oct 1, 2013. The two are quite different. The one in
        the left panel corresponds to HPQ, a frequently traded and liquid asset. HPQ's LOB has LOs posted
        at every tick out to (at least) 20 ticks away from the midprice. In the right panel, we have FARO's
        LOB. FARO is a seldom traded, illiquid asset. This asset has thinly posted bids and offers and
        irregular gaps in the LOB.
*** Alternate Exchange Structures
        The above approach is not the only possible way to organise an exchange. For example, one could use an
        alternative matching algorithm, such as the *prorata rules* used in some money markets.

        Beyond the legal definitions, we generically distinguish lit (open order book) from dark markets based
        on whether limit book informa­ tion is publicly available or not.
*** Colocation
        Exchanges also control the amount and degree of granularity of the information you receive (e.g., you
        can use the consolidated/public feed at a low cost or pay a relatively much larger cost for
        direct/proprietary feeds from the exchanges). They also monetise the need for speed by renting out
        computer/server space next to their matching engines, a process called *colocation*. Through colocation,
        exchanges can provide uniform service to trading clients at competitive rates. Having the traders'
        trading engines at a common location owned by the exchange simplifies the exchange's ability to
        provide uniform service as it can control the hardware connecting each client to the trading engine,
        the cable (so all have the same cable of the same length), and the network. This ensures that all
        traders in colocation have the same fast access, and are not disadvantaged (at least in terms of
        exchange-provided hardware).
*** Extended Order Types
        * *Day Orders*: orders for trading during regular trading with options to extend to pre- or post-market sessions;
        * *Non-routable*: there are a number of orders that by choice or design avoid the default re-routing to
          other exchanges, such as 'book only', 'post only', 'midpoint peg', ...;
        * *Pegged, Hide-not-Slide*: orders that move with the midpoint or the national best price;
        * *Hidden*: orders that do not display their quantity;
        * *Iceberg*: orders that partially display their quantity (some have options so that the visible portion
          will automatically be replenished when it is depleted by less than one round lot);
        * *Immediate-or-Cancel*: orders that execute as much as possible at the best price and the rest are
          cancelled (such orders are not re-routed to another exchange nor do they walk the book);
        * *Fill-or-Kill*: orders sent to be executed at the best price in their entirety or not at all;
        * *Good-Till-Time*: orders with a fixed lifetime built into them so that they will be cancelled if not
          executed by its expiration time;
        * *Discretionary*: orders display one price (the limit price) but may be executed at more aggressive
          (hidden) prices;

        *Addition of LO to LOB*. In Figure ref:f1.2, LOs are displayed as blocks of length equal to their
        quantities. LOs are ordered in terms of time priority from right to left, so that when a new buy LO
        comes in at $23.09 (the purple block) it will be added to the line of blocks already at that price.
        This new LO joins the queue at the point closest to the y-axis, becoming the third LO waiting to be
        executed at $23.09.

        *MO walks the LOB or is re-routed*.
