    A *category* consists of
    * a collection of *objects* \(X,Y,Z,\dots\)
    * a collection of *morphisms* \(f,g,h,\dots\)


    so that
    * Each morphism has specified *domain* and *codomain* objects; the notation \(f:X\to Y\)
      signifies that \(f\) is a morphism with domain \(X\) and codomain \(Y\)
    * Each object has a designated *identity morphism* \(1_X:X\to X\)
    * For any pair of morphisms \(f,g\) with the codomain of \(f\) equal to the domain of \(g\),
      there exists a specified *composite morphism* \(gf\) whose domain is equal to the domain
      of \(f\) and whose codomain is equal to the codomain of \(g\), i.e., :
      \begin{equation*}
      f:X\to Y,\quad g:Y\to Z\hspace{0.7cm}\leadsto\hspace{0.7cm}gf:X\to Z
      \end{equation*}


    This data is subject to the following two axioms
    * For any \(f:X\to Y\), the composites \(1_Yf\) and \(f1_X\) are both equal to \(f\)
    * For any composable triple of morphisms \(f,g,h\), the composites \(h(gf)\) and \((hg)f\) are
      equal and hence denoted by \(hgf\).
      \begin{equation*}
      f:X\to Y,\quad g:Y\to Z,\quad h:Z\to W\hspace{0.7cm}\leadsto\hspace{0.7cm}hgf:X\to W

    1. For any language \(\call\) and any theory \(T\) of \(\call\), there is a category \(\MODEL_T\) whose
       objects are models of \(T\). Morphisms is just homomorphisms
    2. For a fixed unital but not necessarily commutative ring \(R\), \(\Mod_R\) is the category of
       left \(R\)-modules and \(R\)-modules homomorphisms. This category is denoted by \(\Vect_{\Bbbk}\)
       when the ring happens to be a field \(\Bbbk\) and abbreviated as \(\Ab\) in the case
       of \(\Mod_{\Z}\), as a \(\Z\)-module is precisely ab abelian group

    *Concrete categories* are those whose objects have underlying sets and whose morphisms are
    functions between underlying sets

    A category is *small* if it has only a set's worth of arrows

    Both \(\ob(\calc)\) and \(\hom(\calc)\) are sets
    #+END_definition

    Thus it has only a set's worth of objects

    A category is *locally small* if between any pair of objects there is only a set's worth of morphisms

    The set of arrows between a pair of fixed objects in a locally small category is typically

    An *isomorphism* in a category is a morphism \(f:X\to Y\) for which there exists a

    For any category \(\calc\) and any object \(c\in\calc\), show that
    1. There is a category \(c/\calc\) whose objects are morphisms \(f:c\to x\) with domain \(c\) in which
       a morphism from \(f:c\to x\) to \(g:c\to y\) is a map \(h:x\to y\) between the codomains so that
       the triangle

       x\ar[rr,"h"']&&y
       \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
       commutes.
    2. There is a category \(\calc/c\) whose objects are morphisms \(f:x\to c\) with codomain \(c\) in which
       a morphism from \(f:x\to c\) to \(g:y\to c\) is a map \(h:x\to y\) between the codomains so that
       the triangle

    The category \(c/\calc\) and \(\calc/c\) are called *slice categories* of \(\calc\) *under* and *over* \(c\), respectively

** Duality
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    Let \(\calc\) be any category. The *opposite category* \(\calc^{\op}\) has
    * the same objects as in \(\calc\)
    * a morphism \(\fop\) in \(\Cop\) for each a morphism \(f\) in \(\calc\) so that the domain
      of \(\fop\) is defined to be the codomain of \(f\) and the codomain of \(\fop\) is defined to
      be the domain of \(f\)
    * For each object \(X\), the arrow \(1_X^{\op}\) serves as its identity in \(\Cop\)
    * A pair of morphisms \(\fop,\gop\) in \(\Cop\) is composable precisely when the pair \(g,f\) is
      composable in \(\calc\). We then define \(\gop\circ\fop\) to be \((f\circ g)^{\op}\): i.e.
      \begin{equation*}
      \dom(\fop)=\cod(f)=\dom(g)=\cod(\gop)

    label:lemma1.2.3
    T.F.A.E.
    1. \(f:x\to y\) is an isomorphism
    2. For all objects \(c\in\calc\), post-composition with \(f\) defines a bijection
       \begin{equation*}
       f_*:\Hom(c,x)\to\Hom(c,y)
       \end{equation*}
    3. For all objects \(c\in\calc\), pre-composition with \(f\) defines a bijection
       \begin{equation*}
       f^*:\Hom(y,c)\to\Hom(x,c)
       \end{equation*}
    #+END_lemma

    Lemma ref:lemma1.2.3 asserts that isomorphisms in a locally small category are defined
    /representably/ in terms of isomorphisms in the category of sets.

    #+BEGIN_proof
    \(2\to 1\). Let \(c=y\), since \(f_*\) in an bijection, there must be an element \(g\in\Hom(y,x)\)
    s.t. \(f_*(g)=1_y\). Hence \(fg=1_y\). Thus \(gf,1_x\) have common image under \(f_*\),
    thus \(gf=1_x\). Whence \(f\) and \(g\) are inverse isomorphisms
    #+END_proof

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    A morphism \(f:x\to y\) in a category is
    1. a *monomorphism* if for any parallel morphisms \(h,k:w\rightrightarrows x\), \(fg=fk\) implies
       that \(h=k\)
    2. an *epimorphism* if for any parallel morphisms \(h,k:w\rightrightarrows x\), \(hf=kf\) implies
       that \(h=k\)
    #+END_definition

    Also, we can re-express it
    1. \(f:x\to y\) is a monomorphism in \(\calc\) iff for all
       objects \(c\in\calc\), \(f_*:\Hom(c,x)\to\Hom(c,y)\) is injective
    2. \(f:x\to y\) is an epimorphism in \(\calc\) iff for all \(c\in\calc\), \(f^*:\Hom(y,c)\to\Hom(x,c)\)  is
       injective


    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_examplle
    Suppose that \(x\xrightarrow{s}y\xrightarrow{r}x\) are morphisms s.t. \(rs=1_x\). The map \(s\) is a *section* or *right
    inverse* to \(r\), while the map \(r\) defines a *retraction* or *left inverse* to \(s\). The
    maps \(s\) and \(r\) express the object \(x\) as a *retract* of the object \(y\)

    In this case, \(s\) is always a monomorphism and, dually, \(r\) is always an epimorphism. To
    ackowledge the presence of these one-sided inverses, \(s\) is said to be a *split monomorphism*
    and \(r\) is said to be a *split epimorphism*

    By the previous example, an isomorphism is necessarily both monic and epic, but the converse
    need not hold in general. For example, the inclusion \(\Z\hookrightarrow\Q\) is both monic and epic in the
    category \(\Rng\), but this map is not an isomorphism: there are no ring homomorphisms
    from \(\Q\) to \(\Z\)

    1. If \(f:x\rightarrowtail y\) and \(g:y\rightarrowtail z\) are monomorphisms, then so
       is \(gf:x\rightarrowtail z\)
    2. If \(f:x\to y\) and \(g:y\to z\) are morphisms so that \(gf\) is monic, then \(f\) is monic


    Dually
    1. If \(f:x\twoheadrightarrow y\) and \(g:y\twoheadrightarrow z\) are epimorphisms, then so
       is \(gf:x\twoheadrightarrow z\)
    2. If \(f:x\to y\) and \(g:y\to z\) are morphisms so that \(gf\) is epic, then \(g\) is epic

    2. Show that a morphism \(f:x\to y\) is a split monomorphism in a category \(\calc\) iff for

    Prove that a morphism that is both a monomorphism and a split epimorphism is necessarily an
    isomorphism. Argue by duality that a split monomorphism that is an epimorphism is also an isomorphism
    #+END_exercise

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Suppose \(y\xrightarrow{g}x\xrightarrow{f}y\) and \(fg=1_y\), then \(fgf=f=f\circ 1_x\). Since \(f\) is mono, \(gf=1_x\)

    label:thm1.5.9
    A functor defining an equivalence of categories is full, faithful and essentially surjective on
    objects. Assuming the axiom of choice, any functor with these properties defines an equivalence
    of categories
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    First suppose that \(F:\bC\leftrightarrows\bD:G\), \(\eta:1_{\bC}\cong GF\) and \(\epsilon:FG\cong 1_{\bD}\) define an
    equivalence of categories. For any \(d\in\bD\), the component of the natural
    isomorphism \(\epsilon_d:FGd\cong d\) demonstrates that \(F\) is essentially surjective. Consider a
    parallel pair \(f,g:c\rightrightarrows c'\) in \(\bC\). If \(Ff=Fg\), then both \(f\) and \(g\)
    define an arrow \(c\to c'\) making the diagram
    \begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
    c\ar[r,"\eta_c","\cong"']\ar[d,"f\text{ or }g" description]&GFc\ar[d,"GFf=GFg" description]\\
    c'\ar[r,"cong","\eta_{c'}"']&GFc'
    \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
    that expresses the naturality of \eta commute. Lemma implies that there is a unique arrow \(c\to c'\)
    with this property, whence \(f=g\). Thus \(F\) is faithful and by symmetry, so is \(G\).
    Given \(k:Fc\to Fc'\), by Lemma ref:lemma1.5.10, \(Gk\) and the isomorphism \(\eta_c\) and \(\eta_{c'}\)
    define a unique \(h:c\to c'\) for which both \(Gk\) and \(GFh\) make the diagram
    \begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
    c\ar[r,"\eta_c","\cong"']\ar[d,dashed,"h"']&GFc\ar[d,"Gk\text{ or }GFh" description]\\
    c'\ar[r,"\cong","\eta_{c'}"']&GFc'
    \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
    commute. By Lemma ref:lemma1.5.10, \(GFh=Gk\)

    For the converse, suppose now that \(F:\bC\to\bD\) is full, faithful and essentially surjective on
    objects. Using essential surjectivity and the axiom of choice, choose, for each \(d\in\bD\), an
    object \(Gd\in\bC\) and an isomorphism \(\epsilon_d:FGd\cong d\). For each \(l:d\to d'\), Lemma ref:lemma1.5.10
    defines a unique morphism making the square
    \begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
    FGd\ar[r,"\epsilon_d","\cong"']\ar[d,dashed]&d\ar[d,"l"]\\
    FGd'\ar[r,"\cong","\epsilon_{d'}"']&d'
    \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
    commute. Since \(F\) is fully faithful, there is a unqiue morphism \(Gd\to G'\) with this image
    under \(F\), which we define to be \(Gl\).
