   Let \(L\) be a language. An *\(L\)-structure* is a pair \(\fA=(A,(Z^{\fA})_{Z\in L})\) where
   | \(A\)           | if a non-empty set, the *domain* or *universe* of \(\fA\) |
   | \(z^{\fA}\in A\)    | if \(Z\) is a constant                              |
   | \(Z^{\fA}:A^n\to A\) | if \(Z\) is an \(n\)-ary function symbol            |
   | \(Z^{\fA}\subseteq A^n\)   | if \(Z\) is an \(n\)-ary relation symbol            |

   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(\fA,\fB\) be \(L\)-structures. A map \(h:A\to B\) is called a
   *homomorphism* if for all \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\)
   \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{rcl}
    h(c^{\fA})&=&c^{\fB}\\
    h(f^{\fA}(a_1,\dots,a_n))&=&f^{\fB}(h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n))\\
    R^{\fA}(a_1,\dots,a_n)&\Rightarrow&R^{\fB}(h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n))
    \end{array}
   \end{equation*}

   We denote this by
   \begin{equation*}
    h:\fA\to\fB
   \end{equation*}
   
   If in addition \(h\) is injective and
   \begin{equation*}
    R^{\fA}(a_1,\dots,a_n)\Leftrightarrow R^{\fB}(h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n))
   \end{equation*}
   for all \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\), then \(h\) is called an (isomorphic)
   *embedding*. An *isomorphism* is a surjective embedding

   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   We call \(\fA\) a *substructure* of \(\fB\) if \(A\subseteq B\) and if the inclusion map is an embedding
   from \(\fA\) to \(\fB\). We denote this by
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\subseteq\fB
   \end{equation*}
   We say \(\fB\) is an *extension* of \(\fA\) if \(\fA\) is a substructure of \(\fB\)
   #+END_definition

   #+BEGIN_lemma
   label:lemma1.1.8
   Let \(h:\fA \isoto\fA'\) be an isomorphism and \(\fB\) an
   extension of \(\fA\). Then there exists an extension \(\fB'\) of \(\fA'\) and
   an isomorphism \(g:\fB \isoto\fB' \) extending \(h\)
   #+END_lemma

   For any family \(\fA_i\) of substructures of \(\fB\), the intersection of the
   \(A_i\) is either empty or a substructure of \(\fB\). Therefore if \(S\) is
   any non-empty subset of \(\fB\), then there exists a smallest substructure
   \(\fA=\la S\ra^{\fB}\) which contains \(S\). We call the \(\fA\) the
   substructure *generated* by \(S\)

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   If \(\fa=\la S\ra\), then every homomorphism \(h:\fA\to\fB\) is determined by
   its values on \(S\)
   #+END_lemma

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
    Let \((I,\le)\) be a *directed partial order*. This means that for all
    \(i,j\in I\) there exists a \(k\in I\) s.t. \(i\le k\) and \(j\le k\). A
    family \((\fA_i)_{i\in I}\) of \(L\)-structures is called *directed* if
    \begin{equation*}
    i\le j\Rightarrow\fA_i\subseteq\fA_j
    \end{equation*}
    If \(I\) is linearly ordered, we call \((\fA_i)_{i\in I}\) a *chain*
   #+END_definition

   If a structure \(\fA_1\) is isomorphic to a substructure \(\fA_0\) of itself,
   \begin{equation*}
    h_0:\fA_0\isoto\fA_1
   \end{equation*}
   then Lemma ref:lemma1.1.8 gives an extension
   \begin{equation*}
    h_1:\fA_1\isoto\fA_2
   \end{equation*}
   Continuing in this way we obtain a chain 
   \(\fA_0\subseteq \fA_1\subseteq\fA_2\subseteq\dots\)
   and an increasing sequence
   \(h_i:\fA_i\isoto\fA_{i+1}\) of isomorphism

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   Let \((\fA_i)_{i\in I}\) be a directed family of \(L\)-structures. Then
   \(A=\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i\) is the universe of a (uniquely determined)
   \(L\)-structure
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA=\bigcup_{i\in I}\fA_i
   \end{equation*}
   which is an extension of all \(\fA_i\)
   #+END_lemma
   
   A subset \(K\) of \(L\) is called a *sublanguage*. An \(L\)-structure becomes a
   \(K\)-structure, the *reduct*.
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\restriction K=(A,(Z^{\fA})_{Z\in K})
   \end{equation*}
   Conversely we call \(\fA\) an *expansion* of \(\fA\restriction K\).
   1. Let \(B\subseteq A\) , we obtain a new language
      \begin{equation*}
      L(B)=L\cup B
      \end{equation*}
      and the \(L(B)\)-structure 
      \begin{equation*}
      \fA_B=(\fA,b)_{b\in B}
      \end{equation*}
      Note that \(\Aut(\fA_B)\) is the group of automorphisms of \(\fA\) fixing
      \(B\) elementwise. We denote this group by \(\Aut(\fA/B)\)
      
      
   Let \(S\) be a set, which we call the set of sorts. An \(S\)-sorted
   language \(L\) is given by a set of constants for each sort in \(S\), and
   typed function and relations. For any tuple \((s_1,\dots,s_n)\) and
   \((s_1,\dots,s_n,t)\) there is a set of relation symbols and function
   symbols respectively. An \(S\)-sorted structure is a pair
   \(\fA=(A,(Z^{\fA})_{Z\in L})\), where 
   \begin{alignat*}{2}      
   &A&&\text{if a family $(A_s)_{s\in S}$ of non-empty sets}\\
   &Z^{\fA}\in A_s&&\text{if $Z$ is a constant of sort $s\in S$}\\
   &Z^{\fA}:A_{s_1}\times\dots\times A_{s_n}\to A_t&&\text{if $Z$ is a
   function symbol of type $(s_1,\dots,s_n,t)$}\\
   &Z^{\fA}\subseteq A_{s_1}\times\dots\times A_{s_n}&&\text{if $Z$ is a
   relation symbol of type $(s_1,\dots,s_n)$}
   \end{alignat*}

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   Consider the two-sorted language \(L_{Perm}\) for permutation groups with a
   sort \(x\) for the set and a sort \(g\) for the group. The constants and
   function symbols for \(L_{Perm}\) are those of \(L_{Group}\) restricted to
   the sort \(g\) and an additional function symbol \varphi of type \((x,g,x)\). Thus
   an \(L_{Perm}\)-structure \((X,G)\) is given by a set \(X\) and an
   \(L_{Group}\)-structure \(G\) together with a function \(X\times G\to X\)
   #+END_examplle

** Language

   #+BEGIN_lemma
   label:lemma1.2.11
   Suppose \(\vv{b}\) and \(\vv{c}\) agree on all variables which are free
   in \varphi. Then 
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\varphi[\vv{b}]\Leftrightarrow\fA\vDash\varphi[\vv{c}]
   \end{equation*}
   #+END_lemma

   We define
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\varphi[a_1,\dots,a_n]
   \end{equation*}
   by \(\fA\vDash\varphi[\vv{b}]\), where \(\vv{b}\) is an assignment
   satisfying \(\vv{b}(x_i)=a_i\). Because of Lemma ref:lemma1.2.11 this is
   well defined.

   


   Thus \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) defines an \(n\)-ary relation
   \begin{equation*}
   \varphi(\fA)=\{\bbar{a}\mid\fA\vDash\varphi[\bbar{a}]\}
   \end{equation*}
   on \(A\), the *realisation set* of \varphi. Such realisation sets are called
   *0-definable subsets* of \(A^n\), or 0-definable relations

   Let \(B\) be a subset of \(A\). A *\(B\)-definable* subset of \(\fA\) is a set
   of the form \(\varphi(\fA)\) for an \(L(B)\)-formula \(\varphi(x)\). We also say that \varphi
   are defined *over* \(B\) and that the set \(\varphi(\fA)\) is defined by \varphi. We call
   two formulas *equivalent* if in every structure they define the same set.

   Atomic formulas and their negations are called *basic*. Formulas without
   quantifiers are Boolean combinations of basic formulas. It is convenient to
   allow the empty conjunction and the empty disjunction. For that we introduce
   two new formulas: the formula \(\top\), which is always true, and the formula
   \(\bot\), which is always false. We define
   \begin{align*}
   &\bigwedge_{i<0}\pi_i=\top\\
   &\bigvee_{i<0}\pi_i=\bot
   \end{align*}

   A formula is in *negation normal form* if it is built from basic formulas using
   \(\wedge,\vee,\exists,\forall\)

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   Every formula can be transformed into an equivalent formula which is in negation normal form
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(\sim\) denote equivalence of formulas. We consider formulas which are built
   using \(\wedge,\vee,\exists,\forall,\neg\) and move the negation symbols in front of atomic formulas using
   \begin{align*}
   \neg(\varphi\wedge\psi)&\sim(\neg\varphi\vee\neg\psi)\\
   \neg(\varphi\vee\psi)&\sim(\neg\varphi\wedge\neg\psi)\\
   \neg\exists x\varphi&\sim\forall x\neg\varphi\\
   \neg\forall x\varphi&\sim\exists x\neg\varphi\\
   \neg\neg\varphi&\sim\varphi
   \end{align*}
   #+END_proof

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A formula in negation normal form which does not contain any existential
   quantifier is called *universal*. Formulas in negation normal form without
   universal quantifiers are called *existential*

   Let \(h:\fA\to\fB\) be an embedding. Then for all existential formulas \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) and
   all \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\) we have
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\varphi[a_1,\dots_,a_n]\Rightarrow\fB\vDash\varphi[h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n)]
   \end{equation*}
   For universal \varphi, the dual holds
   \begin{equation*}
   \fB\vDash\varphi[h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n)]\Rightarrow
   \fA\vDash\varphi[a_1,\dots,a_n]
   \end{equation*}
   #+END_lemma

   
   Let \(\fA\) be an \(L\)-structure. The *atomic diagram* of \(\fA\) is
   \begin{equation*}
   \Diag(\fA)=\{\varphi\text{ basic $L(A)$-sentence}\mid\fA_A\vDash\varphi\}
   \end{equation*}

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   The models of \(\Diag(\fA)\) are precisely those structures
   \((\fB,h(a))_{a\in A}\) for embeddings \(h:\fA\to\fB\)
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   The structures \((\fB,h(a))_{a\in A}\) are models of the atomic diagram by Lemma ref:1.2.16.  For
   the converse, note that a map \(h\) is an embedding iff it preserves the validity of all formulas
   of the form
   \begin{align*}
   &(\neg)x_1\dot{=}x_2\\
   &c\dot=x_1\\
   &f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\dot=x_0\\

* Elementary Extensions and Compactness
** Elementary substructures
   Let \(\fA,\fB\) be two \(L\)-structures. A map \(h:A\to B\) is called
   *elementary* if for all \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\) we have
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\varphi[a_1,\dots,a_n]\Leftrightarrow
   \fB\vDash\varphi[h(a_1),\dots,h(a_n)]
   \end{equation*}
   which is actually saying \((\fA,a)_{a\in A}\equiv(\fB,a)_{a\in A}\).
   We write
   \begin{equation*}
   h:\fA\embto\fB
   \end{equation*}
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

   \((\fB,h(a))_{a\in A}\) for elementary embeddings \(h:\fA\embto\fB\)
   #+END_lemma

   We call \(\Th(\fA_A)\) the *elemantary diagram* of \(\fA\)

   A substructure \(\fA\) of \(\fB\) is called *elementary* if the inclusion map
   is elementary. In this case we write
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\prec\fB
   \end{equation*}

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Tarski's Test]
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   label:thm2.1.2
   Let \(\fB\) be an \(L\)-structure and \(A\) a subset of \(B\). Then \(A\) is
   the universe of an elementary substructure iff every \(L(A)\)-formula
   \(\varphi(x)\) which is satisfiable in \(\fB\) can be satisfied by an element of \(A\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If \(\fA\prec\fB\) and \(\fB\vDash\exists x\varphi(x)\), we also have \(\fA\vDash\exists x\varphi(x)\) and there exists \(a\in A\)
   s.t. \(\fA\vDash\varphi(a)\). Thus \(\fB\vDash\varphi(a)\)

   Conversely, suppose that the condition of Tarski'test is satisfied. First we show that \(A\) is
   the universe of a substructure \(\fA\). The \(L(A)\)-formula \(x\dot=x\) is satisfiable in \(\fA\),
   so \(A\) is not empty. If \(f\in L\) is an \(n\)-ary function symbol \((n\ge 0)\) and \(a_1,\dots,a_n\) is
   from \(A\), we consider the formula
   \begin{equation*}
   \varphi(x)=f(a_1,\dots,a_n)\dot=x
   \end{equation*}
   Since \(\varphi(x)\) is always satisfied by an element of \(A\), it follows that \(A\) is closed
   under \(f^{\calb}\)

   Now we show, by induction on \psi, that
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\psi\Leftrightarrow\fB\vDash\psi
   \end{equation*}
   for all \(L(A)\)-sentences \psi.

   For \(\psi=\exists x\varphi(x)\). If \psi holds in \(\fA\), there exists \(a\in A\)
   s.t. \(\fA\vDash\varphi(a)\). The induction hypothesis yields \(\fB\vDash\varphi(x)\), thus \(\fB\vDash\psi\). For the converse
   suppose \psi holds in \(\fB\). Then \(\varphi(x)\) is satisfied in \(\calb\) and by Tarski's test we
   find \(a\in A\) s.t. \(\fB\vDash\varphi(a)\). By induction \(\fA\vDash\varphi(a)\) and \(\fA\vDash\psi\)
   #+END_proof

   Suppose \(S\) is a subset of the \(L\)-structure \(\fB\). Then \(\fB\) has a

   #+END_corollary

   #+BEGIN_proof
   We construct \(A\) as the union of an ascending sequence \(S_0\subseteq S_1\subseteq\dots\) of subsets of \(B\). We
   start with \(S_0=S\). If \(S_i\) is already defined, we choose an element \(a_\varphi\in B\) for
   every \(L(S_i)\)-formula \(\varphi(x)\) which is satisfiable in \(\fB\) and define \(S_{i+1}\) to
   be \(S_i\) together with these \(a_{\varphi}\).

   An \(L\)-formula is a finite sequence of symbols from \(L\), auxiliary symbols and logical
   symbols. These are \(\abs{L}+\aleph_0=\max(\abs{L},\aleph_0)\) many symbols and there are
   exactly\(\max(\abs{L},\aleph_0)\) many \(L\)-formulas

   Let \(\kappa=\max(\abs{S},\abs{L},\aleph_0)\). There are \kappa many
   \(L(S)\)-formulas: therefore \(\abs{S_1}\le\kappa\). Inductively it follows
   for every \(i\) that \(\abs{S_i}\le\kappa\). Finally we have \(\abs{A}\le\kappa\cdot\aleph_0=\kappa\)

** The Compactness Theorem
   We call a theory \(T\) *finitely satisfiable* if every finite subset of \(T\) is consistent

   Finitely satisfiable theories are consistent
   #+END_theorem
   
   Let \(L\) be a language and \(C\) a set of new constants. An \(L(C)\)-theory
   \(T'\) is called a *Henkin theory* if for every \(L(C)\)-formula \(\varphi(x)\) there
   is a constant \(c\in C\) s.t.
   \begin{equation*}
   \exists x\varphi(x)\to\varphi(c)\in T'
   \end{equation*}
   The elements of \(C\) are called *Henkin constants* of \(T'\)

   An \(L\)-theory \(T\) is *finitely complete* if it is finitely satisfiable and if
   every \(L\)-sentence \varphi satisfies \(\varphi\in T\) or \(\neg\varphi\in T\)

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   Every finitely satisfiable \(L\)-theory \(T\) can be extended to a finitely
   complete Henkin Theory \(T^*\)
   #+END_lemma

   Note that conversely the lemma follows directly from the Compactness Theorem. Choose a
   model \(\fA\) of \(T\). Then \(\Th(\fA_A)\) is a finitely complete Henkin theory with \(A\) as a set
   of Henkin constants

   #+BEGIN_proof
   We define an increasing sequence \(\emptyset=C_0\subseteq C_1\subseteq\cdots\) of new constants by assigning to
   every \(L(C_i)\)-formula \(\varphi(x)\) a constant \(c_{\varphi(x)}\) and
   \begin{equation*}
   C_{i+1}=\{c_{\varphi(x)}\mid \varphi(x)\text{ a }L(C_i)\text{-formula}\}
   \end{equation*}
   Let \(C\) be the union of the \(C_i\) and \(T^H\) the set of all Henkin axioms
   \begin{equation*}
   \exists x\varphi(x)\to\varphi(c_{\varphi(x)})
   \end{equation*}
   for \(L(C)\)-formulas \(\varphi(x)\). It is easy to see that one can expand every \(L\)-structure to a
   model of \(T^H\). Hence \(T\cup T^H\) is a finitely satisfiable Henkin theory. Using the fact that the
   union of a chain of finitely satisfiable theories is also finite satisfiable, we can apply Zorn's
   Lemma and get a maximal finitely satisfiable \(L(C)\)-theory \(T^*\) which contains \(T\cup T^H\). As
   in Lemma ref:lemma1.3.7 we show that \(T^*\) is finitely complete: if neither \(\varphi\) nor \(\neg\varphi\)
   belongs to \(T^*\), neither \(T^*\cup\{\varphi\}\) nor \(T^*\cup\{\neg\varphi\}\) would be finitely satisfiable. Hence
   there would be a finite subset \Delta of \(T^*\) which would be consistent neither with \varphi nor
   with \(\neg\varphi\). Then \Delta itself would be inconsistent and \(T^*\) would not be finite satisfiable.
   This proves the lemma.

   \end{equation*}
   with \(A=\{a_c\mid c\in C\}\)
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Since \(T^*\) is finite complete, every sentence which follows from a finite subset of \(T^*\)
   belongs to \(T^*\)

   Define for \(c,d\in C\)
   \begin{equation*}
   c\simeq d\Leftrightarrow c\dot=d\in T^*
   \end{equation*}
   \(\simeq\) is an equivalence relation. We denote the equivalence class of \(c\) by \(a_c\), and set
   \begin{equation*}
   A=\{a_c\mid c\in C\}
   \end{equation*}
   We expand \(A\) to an \(L\)-structure \(\fA\) by defining
   \begin{align*}
   R^{\fA}(a_{c_1},\dots,a_{c_n})&\Leftrightarrow R(c_1,\dots,c_n)\in T^*\tag{\star}\\
   f^{\fA}(a_{c_1},\dots,a_{c_n})&\Leftrightarrow f(c_1,\dots,c_n)\dot=c_0\in T^*\tag{\star\star}
   \end{align*}

   We have to show that this is well-defined. For (\(\star\)) we have to show that
   \begin{equation*}
   a_{c_1}=a_{d_1},\dots,a_{c_n}=a_{d_n}, R(c_1,\dots,c_n)\in T^*
   \end{equation*}
   implies \(R(d_1,\dots,d_n)\in T^*\), which is obvious.

   For (\(\star\star\)), we have to show that for all \(c_1,\dots,c_n\) there exists \(c_0\)
   with \(f(c_1,\dots,c_n)\dot=c_0\in T^*\).

   Let \(\fA^*\) be the \(L(C)\)-structure \((\fA,a_c)_{c\in C}\). We show by induction on the complexity
   of \varphi that for every \(L(C)\)-sentence \varphi
   \begin{equation*}

   So an element \(a\) realises the type \(p\in S(B)\) exactly if
   \(p=\tp(a/B)\). If \(\fA'\) is an elementary extension of \(\fA\), then

   This theory is finitely satisfiable since every \(p\) is finitely satisfiable
   in \(\fA\).

   Or use Lemma ref:lemma2.2.7. Let \((p_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}\) be an enumeration of

   \(2\to1\).   Here we add some details for the proof \(2\to 1\). If \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) cannot be separated by a

  universal sentence. That is, for all universal sentence \varphi, if \(\fA_1\vDash\varphi\) then \(\fA_2\vDash\varphi\).
  Thus \(\fA_1\Rightarrow_\forall\fA_2\), here \(\Rightarrow_\forall\) means for all universal sentence.

  Now note that

  \fA_1\vDash\varphi\to\fA_2\vDash\varphi\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\fA_2\vDash\neg\varphi\to\fA_2\vDash\neg\varphi

  and \(\neg\varphi\) is an existential sentence. Hence we have

  The reason that we want to use \(\exists\) is that it holds in the substructure case and we could

  have \(\fA_1'\equiv\fA_1\) and a map \(f:\fA_2\to_\exists\fA_1'\).

   \(1\to 2\). Assume \varphi is a \(\forall\exists\)-sentence which separates \(T_1\) from \(T_2\), \((\fA_i)_{i\in I}\) is a
   directed family of models of \varphi, by Lemma ref:lemma3.1.6 \(\fB\) is also a model of \varphi.
   Since \(\fB\vDash\varphi\), \(\fB\) cannot be a model of \(T_2\)

   \(2\to1\). If (1) is not true, Suppose \(\fA\vDash T_1\) and \(\fB^0\vDash T_2\). Then
  \begin{equation*}
  \fA\Rightarrow_{\forall\exists}\fB^0
  \end{equation*}
  Again we have
  \begin{equation*}
  \fB^0\Rightarrow_{\exists\forall}\fA
  \end{equation*}
  we have a map
  \begin{equation*}
  f':\fB^0\to_{\exists\forall}\fA^0
  \end{equation*}
  where \(\fA^0\equiv\fA\). Since \(\forall\)-sentences are also \(\exists\forall\)-sentences, we thus have a map \(f:\fB^0\to_{\forall}\fA^0\).

  Here we need to prove that \(\fB^0\) is isomorphic to a substructure of \(\fA^0\), which is clear
  since \(f\) is an embedding.
  Then we can assume that \(\fB^0\subseteq\fA^0\) and \(f\) is the inclusion map. Then
  \begin{equation*}
  \fA_B^0\Rightarrow_\exists\fB_B^0
  \end{equation*}
  (Here we are talking about existential sentences in the original language.
   If \(\fB^0\vDash\exists\barx\varphi(\barx)\) for some \(\varphi(\barx)\), then \(\fB^0\vDash\varphi(\barb)\). So we can use constants
   \(B\) to talk about existential sentences)
   Applying Lemma ref:lemma3.1.2 again, we obtain an extension \(\fB_B^1\) of
   \(\fA_B^0\) with \(\fB_B^1\equiv\fB_B^0\), i.e. \(\fB^0\prec\fB^1\). Hence we
   have an infinite chain
   \begin{gather*}
   \fB^0\subseteq\fA^0\subseteq^1\fB^1\subseteq\fA^1\subseteq\fB^2\subseteq\cdots\\
   \fB^0\prec\fB^1\prec\fB^2\prec\cdots\\
   \fA^i\equiv\fA
   \end{gather*}
   Let \(\fB\) be the union of the \(\fA^i\).  Since \(\fB\) is also the union
   of the elementary chain of the \(\fB^i\), it is an elementary extension of
   \(\fB^0\) and hence a model of \(T_2\). But the \(\fA^i\) are models of

      \begin{equation*}
      T_1=T\cup\{\varphi\} \quad\text{ and }\quad T_2=T\cup\{\neg\varphi\}
      \end{equation*}
      Part (b) says that the union of a chain of models of \(T_1\) cannot be a
      model of \(T_2\). By Theorem ref:thm3.1.8 we can separate \(T_1\) and
      \(T_2\) by an \(\forall\exists\)-sentence \psi. Hence
      \(T\cup\{\varphi\}\vDash\psi\) and

   2. Clearly \(\forall\exists\)-axiomatised theories are inductive. For the

   _Then \(T\) is either inconsistent or complete._

   It's easy to transform any theory \(T\) into a theory with quantifier

   \(3\to1\). Let \(\varphi(\bbar{x})\) be a primitive existential formula. In order
   to show that \(\varphi(\bbar{x})\) is equivalent, modulo \(T\), to a
   quantifier-free formula \(\rho(\bbar{x})\) we extend \(L\) by an \(n\)-tuple
   \(\bbar{c}\) of new constants \(c_1,\dots,c_n\). *We have to show that we can*
   *separate \(T\cup\{\varphi(\bbar{c})\}\) and \(T\cup\{\neg\varphi(\bbar{c})\}\) by a*
   *quantifier free sentence \(\rho(\bbar{c})\)*. Then \(T\vDash\varphi(\barc)\to\rho(\barc)\)
   and \(T\vDash\neg\varphi(\barc)\to\neg\rho(\barc)\). Hence \(T\vDash\varphi(\barc)\leftrightarrow\rho(\barc)\).

   We apply the Separation Lemma
   (\(\calh\) hear is the set of quantifier-free sentence). Let
   \(\fM^1\) and \(\fM^2\) be two models of \(T\) with two distinguished
   \(n\)-tuples \(\bbar{a}^1\) and \(\bbar{a}^2\). Suppose that
   \((\fM^1,\bbar{a}^1)\) and \((\fM^2,\bbar{a}^2)\) satisfy the same
   quantifier-free \(L(\bbar{c})\)-sentences. We have to show that
   \begin{equation*}
   \fM^1\vDash\varphi(\bbar{a}^1)\Rightarrow
   \fM^2\vDash\varphi(\bbar{a}^2)\tag{\star}
   \end{equation*}
   which says that if \(T\)'s model \(\fA_1,\fA_2\) satisfies the same quantifier-free sentences, then
   \(\fM^1\Rightarrow_{\exists}\fM^2\). If \(\fM^1\vDash T\cup\{\varphi(\barc)\}\) and \(\fM^2\vDash T\cup\{\neg\varphi(\barc)\}\) and satisfy the same
   quantifier-free \(L(\barc)\) sentence, then \(\fM^1\subseteq \fM^2\) , a contradiction.
   Thus we finish the proof

   Consider the substructure \(\fA^i=\la\bbar{a}^i\ra^{\fM^i}\), generated by
   \(\bbar{a}^i\). If we can show that there is an isomorphism
   \begin{equation*}
   f:\fA^1\to\fA^2
   \end{equation*}
   taking \(\bbar{a}\) to \(\bbar{a}\), we may assume that \(\fA^1=\fA^2=\fA\)
   and \(\bbar{a}^1=\bbar{a}^2=\bbar{a}\). Then \(\star\) follows directly from 3.

   Every element of \(\fA^1\) has the form \(t^{\fM^1}[\bbar{a}^1]\) for an
   \(L\)-term \(t(\bbar{x})\). The isomorphism \(f\)to be constructed must
   satisfy
   \begin{equation*}
   f(t^{\fM^1}[\bbar{a}^1])=t^{\fM^2}[\bbar{a}^2]
   \end{equation*}
   We define \(f\) by this equation and have to check that \(f\) is well defined
   and injective. Assume
   \begin{equation*}
   s^{\fM^1}[\bbar{a}^1]=t^{\fM^1}[\bbar{af^1}]
   \end{equation*}
   Then \(\fM^1,\bbar{a}^1\vDash s(\bbar{c})\dot{=}t(\bbar{c})\), and by our
   assumption, \(\fM^1\) and \(\fM^2\) satisfy the same quantifier-free \(L(\barc)\)-sentence,  it also
   holds in \((\fM^2,\bbar{a}^2)\), which means
   \begin{equation*}
   s^{\fM^2}[\bbar{a}^2]=t^{\fM^2}[\bbar{a}^2]
   \end{equation*}
   Swapping the two sides yields injectivity.

   Surjectivity is clear. It remains to show that \(f\) commutes with the
   interpretation of the relation symbols. Now
   \begin{equation*}
   \fM^1\vDash R\left[t_1^{\fM^1}[\bbar{a}^1],\dots,t_m^{\fM^1}[\bbar{a}^1]\right]
   \end{equation*}
   is equivalent to \((\fM^1,\bbar{a}^1)\vDash R(t_1(\bbar{c}),\dots,t_m(\bbar{c}))\), which is equivalent to
   \((\fM^2,\bbar{a}^2)\vDash R(t_1(\bbar{c}),\dots,t_m(\bbar{c}))\), which in turn is equivalent to
   \begin{equation*}
   \fM^2\vDash R\left[t_1^{\fM^2}[\bbar{a}^2],\dots,t_m^{\fM^2}[\bbar{a}^2]\right]

    The structure \(\fA^1=\fA_\kappa\) has the following property: every existential \(L(A)\)-sentence which
    holds in an extension of \(\fA^1\) that is a model of \(T\) holds in \(\fA^1\). Now in the same

    elementary extension \(\fB\) of \(\fA\) which is the identity on \(N\).
    Since \(\fM\) is existentially closed in \(\fB\), it follows that \(\fN\) is

   \(R\). Then \(f\) extends to an isomorphism \(g:G_1\to G_2\) between the

   Case 2: \(b_1\not\in G_1\). Then \(b_1\) is transcendental over \(G\) and the field

   Let \((K_1,<)\) and \((K_2,<)\) be two real closed field with a common subring \(R\). Consider
   an \(L_{ORing}(R)\)-sentence \(\exists y\rho(y)\) (for a quantifier-free \rho), which holds in \((K_1,<)\).
   We have to show \(\exists y\rho(y)\) also holds in \((K_2,<)\)

   We build first the quotient fields \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) of \(R\) in \(K_1\) and \(K_2\). By ref:B.1.1
   there is an isomorphism \(f:(F_1,<)\to(F_2,<)\) which fixes \(R\). The relative algebraic
   closure \(G_i\) of \(F_i\) in \(K_i\) is a real closure of \((F_i,<)\). By ref:B.1.5 \(f\) extends to
   an isomorphism \(g:(G_1,<)\to(G_2,<)\)

   Let \(b_1\in K_1\) which satisfies \(\rho(y)\). There are two cases

   Case 1: \(b_1\in G_1\): Then \(b_2=g(b_1)\) satisfies \(\rho(y)\) in \(K_2\)

   Case 2: \(b_1\not\in G_1\). Then \(b_1\) is transcendental over \(G_1\) and the field
   extension \(G_1(b_1)\) is isomorphic to the rational function field \(G_1(X)\). Let \(G_1^l\) be the
   set of all elements of \(G_1\) which are smaller than \(b_1\), and \(G_1^r\) be the set of all
   elements of \(G_1\) which are larger than \(b_1\). Then all elements of \(G_2^l=g(G_1^l)\) are smaller
   than all elements of \(G_2^r=g(G_1^r)\). Since fields are densely ordered, we find in an elementary
   extension \((K_2',<)\) of \((K_2,<)\) an element \(b_2\) which lies between the elements of \(G_2^l\)
   and the elements of \(G_2^r\). Since \(b_2\) is not in \(G_2\), it is transcendental over \(G_2\).
   Hence \(g\) extends to an isomorphism \(h:G_1(b_1)\to G_2(b_2)\) which maps \(b_1\) to \(b_2\)

   In order to how that \(h\) is order preserving it suffices to show that \(h\) is order preserving
   on \(G_1[b_1]\). Let \(p(b_1)\) be an element of \(G_1[b_1]\). Corollary ref:B.1.8 gives us a
   decomposition
   \begin{equation*}
   p(X)=\epsilon\prod_{i<m}(X-a_i)\prod_{j<n}((X-c_j)^2+d_j)
   \end{equation*}
   with positive \(d_j\). The sign of \(p(b_1)\) depends only on the signs of the factors
   \(\epsilon,b_1-a_0,\dots,b_1-a_{m-1}\). The sign of \(h(p(b_1))\) depends in the same way on the signs
   of \(g(\epsilon),b_2-g(a_0),\dots,b_2-g(a_{m-1})\). But \(b_2\) was chosen in such a way that
   \begin{equation*}
   b_1<a_i\Longleftrightarrow b_2<g(a_i)
   \end{equation*}
   Hence \(p(b_1)\) is positive iff \(h(p(b_1))\) is positive

   Finally we have
   \begin{alignat*}{3}
   &(K_1,<)\vDash\rho(b_1)&&\Rightarrow (G_1(b_1),<)\vDash\rho(b_1)&&\Rightarrow(G_2(b_2),<)\vDash\rho(b_2)\Rightarrow\\

   If \(T\) is countable and consistent and if \(\Sigma(x)\) is not isolated in
   \(T\), then \(T\) has a model which omits \(\Sigma(x)\)
   #+END_theorem

   If \(\Sigma(x)\) is isolated by \(\varphi(x)\) and \(\fA\) is a model of \(T\), then
   \(\Sigma(x)\) is realised in \(\fA\) by all realisations \(\varphi(x)\). Therefore the
   converse of the theorem is true for *complete* theories \(T\): if \(\Sigma(x)\) is
   isolated in \(T\), then it is realised in every model of \(T\) 
   
   #+BEGIN_proof
   We choose a countable set \(C\) of new constants and extend \(T\) to a theory
   \(T^*\) with the following properties
   1. \(T^*\) is a Henkin theory: for all \(L(C)\)-formulas \(\psi(x)\) there
      exists a constant \(c\in C\) with \(\exists x\psi(x)\to\psi(c)\in T^*\)
   2. for all \(c\in C\) there is a \(\sigma(x)\in\Sigma(x)\) with \(\neg\sigma(c)\in T^*\)


   We construct \(T^*\) inductively as the union of an ascending chain
   \begin{equation*}
   T=T_0\subseteq T_1\subseteq T_1\subseteq\dots
   \end{equation*}
   of consistent extensions of \(T\) by finitely many axioms from \(L(C)\), in
   each step making an instance of (1) or (2) true.

   Enumerate \(C=\{c_i\mid i<\omega\}\) and let \(\{\psi_i(x)\mid i<\omega\}\)
   be an enumeration of the \(L(C)\)-formulas

   Assume that \(T_{2i}\) is the already constructed. Choose some \(c\in C\)
   which doesn't occur in \(T_{2i}\cup\{\psi_i(x)\}\) and set
   \(T_{2i+1}=T_{2i}\cup\{\exists x\psi_i(x)\to\psi_i(c)\}\).

   Up to equivalence \(T_{2i+1}\) has the form \(T\cup\{\delta(c_i,\bbar{c})\}\) for
   an \(L\)-formula \(\delta(x,\bbar{y})\) and a tuple \(\bbar{c}\in C\) which
   doesn't contain \(c_i\). Since \(\exists\bbar{y}\delta(x,\bbar{y})\) doesn't
   isolate \(\Sigma(x)\), for some \(\sigma\in\Sigma\) the formula
   \(\exists\bbar{y}\delta(x,\bbar{y})\wedge\neg\sigma(x)\) is consistent with \(T\).
   Thus \(T_{2i+2}=T_{2i+1}\cup\{\neg\sigma(c_i)\}\) is consistent

   Take a model \((\fA',a_c)_{c\in C}\) of \(T^*\). Since \(T^*\) is a Henkin
   theory, Tarski's Test ref:thm2.1.2 shows that \(A=\{a_c\mid c\in C\}\) is the
   universe of an elementary substructure \(\fA\) (Lemma ref:lemma2.2.3). By
   property (2), \(\Sigma(x)\) is omitted in \(\fA\)

** The space of types
   Fix a theory \(T\). An *\(n\)-type* is a maximal set of formulas
   \(p(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) consistent with \(T\). We denote by \(S_n(T)\) the set
   of all \(n\)-types of \(T\). We also write \(S(T)\) for \(S_1(T)\).
   \(S_0(T)\) is all complete extensions of \(T\)

   If \(B\) is a subset of an \(L\)-structure \(\fA\), we recover
   \(S_n^{\fA}(B)\) as \(S_n(\Th(\fA_B))\). In particular, if \(T\) is complete
   and \(\fA\) is any model of \(T\), we have \(S^{\fA}(\emptyset)=S(T)\)

   For any \(L\)-formula \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\), let \([\varphi]\) denote the set of all
   types containing \varphi.

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

      \(S_n(T)\setminus[\varphi]=[\neg\varphi]\), \(S_n(T)=[\top]\) and \(\emptyset=[\bot]\)
   #+END_lemma

   It follows that the collection of sets of the form \([\varphi]\) is closed under
   finite intersection and includes \(S_n(T)\). So these sets form a basis of a

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Being 0-dimensional means having a basis of clopen sets. Our basic open sets
   are clopen since their complements are also basic open

   If \(p\) and \(q\) are two different types, there is a formula \varphi contained in
   \(p\) but not in \(q\). It follows that \([\varphi]\) and \([\neg\varphi]\) are
   open sets which separate \(p\) and \(q\). This shows that \(S_n(T)\) is
   Hausdorff

   To prove compactness, we need to show that any collection of closed subsets
   of \(X\) with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.

   Consider a family \([\varphi_i]\) (\(i\in I\)), with the finite intersection property.This

   consistent with \(T\) and can be extended to a type \(p\), which then belongs
   to all \([\varphi_i]\).

   If \(q(\bbar{x})\in S_n(B_0)\), we define

   If \(\varphi(\bbar{x},f(\bbar{a}))\not\in q(\bbar{x})\), then
   \(\fB\not\vDash\varphi(\bbar{x},\bbar{a})\). Therefore \(\fA\not\vDash\varphi(\bbar{x},\bbar{a})\).
   \(S(f)\) defines a map from \(S_n(B_0)\) to \(S_n(A_0)\). Moreover, it is surjective since
   \(\{\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n,f(\bbar{a}))\mid\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n,a)\in p\}\) is finitely satisfiable for all \(p\in S_n(A_0)\).
   And \(S(f)\) is continuous since \([\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n,f(\bbar{a}))]\) is the preimage of
   \([\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n,\bbar{a})]\) under \(S(f)\)
   #+END_proof

   There are two main cases
   1. An elementary bijection \(f:A_0\to B_0\) defines a homeomorphism
      \(S_n(A_0)\to S_n(B_0)\). We write \(f(p)\) for the image of \(p\)
   2. If \(\fA=\fB\) and \(A_0\subseteq B_0\), the inclusion map induces the
      *restriction* \(S_n(B_0)\to S_n(A_0)\). We write \(q\restriction A_0\) for
      the restriction of \(q\) to \(A_0\). We call \(q\) an extension of

      A type \(p\) is isolated in \(T\) iff \(p\) is an isolated point in

      is an *atom* in the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of \(S_n(T)\)
    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    \(p\) being an isolated point means that \(\{p\}\) is open, that is, \(\{p\}=[\varphi]\).

    The set \([\varphi]\) is a singleton iff \([\varphi]\) is non-empty and cannot be
      divided into two non-empty clopen subsets \([\varphi\wedge\psi]\) and
      \([\varphi\wedge\neg\psi]\). This means that for all \psi either \psi or
      \(\neg\psi\) follows from \varphi modulo \(T\). So \([\varphi]\) is a singleton iff \varphi
      generates the type
      \begin{equation*}
      \la\varphi\ra=\{\psi(\bbar{x})\mid T\vDash\forall\bbar{x}(\varphi(\bbar{x})\to\psi(\bbar{x}))\}
      \end{equation*}
      which is the only element of \([\varphi]\)

      This shows that \([\varphi]=\{p\}\) implies that \varphi isolates \(p\).

      Conversely, \varphi isolates \(p\), this means that \(\la\varphi\ra\) is consistent with \(T\) and
      contains \(p\). Since \(p\) is a type, we have \(p=\la\varphi\ra\)
    #+END_proof

      We call a formula \(\varphi(x)\) *complete* if

      \{\psi(\bbar{x})\mid T\vDash\forall\bbar{x}(\varphi(\bbar{x})\to\psi(\bbar{x}))\}

   Suppose \(\fA\) and \(\fB\) are as in the lemma. We choose enumerations
   \(A=\{a_0,a_1,\dots\}\) and \(B=\{b_0,b_1,\dots\}\). Then we construct an
   ascending sequence \(f_0\subseteq f_1\subseteq \cdots\) of finite elementary
   maps
   \begin{equation*}
   f_i:A_i\to B_i
   \end{equation*}
   between finite subsets of \(\fA\) and \(\fB\). We will choose the \(f_i\) in
   such a way that \(A\) is the union of the \(A_i\) and \(B\) the union of the
   \(B_i\). The union of the \(f_i\) is then the desired isomorphism between
   \(\fA\) and \(\fB\)

   The empty map \(f_0=\emptyset\) is elementary since \(\fA\) and \(\fB\) are
   elementarily equivalent. Assume that \(f_i\) is already constructed. There
   are two cases:

   \(i=2n\); We will extend \(f_i\) to \(A_{i+1}=A_i\cup\{a_n\}\). Consider the
   type
   \begin{equation*}
   p(x)=\tp(a_n/A_i)=\{\varphi(x)\mid\fA\vDash\varphi(a_n), \varphi(x)\text{ a $L(A_i)$-formula}\}
   \end{equation*}
   Since \(f_i\) is elemantarily, \(f_i(p)(x)\) is in \(\fB\) a type over
   \(B_i\). (note that \(f_i\) is elementary iff \(\fA_{A_i}\equiv\fB_{B_i}\))
   Since \(\fB\) is \(\omega\)-saturated, there is a realisation \(b'\)
   of this type. So for \(\bbar{a}\in A_i\)
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA\vDash\varphi(a_n,\bbar{a}) \Rightarrow\fB\vDash\varphi(b',f_i(\bbar{a}))
   \end{equation*}
   Given \(b'\), then the type that it realises is fixed. Hence
   \begin{equation*}
   \fB\vDash\varphi(b',f_i(\bara))\Rightarrow\fA\vDash\varphi(a_n,\bara)
   \end{equation*}
   This shows that \(f_{i+1}(a_n)=b'\) defines an elementary extension of
   \(f_i\)

   \(i=2n+1\); we exchange \(\fA\) and \(\fB\)

   Assume that there are only finitely many \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) relative to
   \(T\) for every \(n\). By Lemma ref:lemma4.3.3 it suffices to show that all
   models of \(T\) are \(\omega\)-saturated. Let \(\fM\) be a model of \(T\) and
   \(A\) an \(n\)-element subset. If there are only \(N\) many formulas, up to
   equivalence, in the variable \(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1}\), there are, up to
   equivalence in \(\fM\), at most \(N\) many \(L(A)\)-formulas \(\varphi(x)\). Thus,
   each type \(\varphi(x)\in S(A)\) is isolated (w.r.t. \(\Th(\fM_A)\)) by a smallest formula \(\varphi_p(x)\)
   (\(\bigwedge p(x)\)). Each element of \(M\) which realises
   \(\varphi_p(x)\) also realises \(p(x)\), so \(\fM\) is \(\omega\)-saturated.

   Conversely, if there are infinitely many \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) modulo \(T\)
   for some \(n\), then - as the type space \(S_n(T)\) is compact - there must
   be some non-isolated type \(p\) (if \(p\) is isolated, then \(\{p\}\) is open). Then by Lemma
   ref:lemma4.2.6 \(p\) is not isolated in \(T\).
   By the Omitting Types Theorem there is a
   countable model of \(T\) in which this type is not realised. On the other
   hand, there also exists a countable model of \(T\) realizing this type. So
   \(T\) is not \(\aleph_0\)-categorical

   The proof shows that a countable complete theory with infinite models is
   \(\aleph_0\)-categorical iff all countable models are \(\omega\)-saturated

   types \(p(x),q(x)\in S_n(T)\), then there is \(\phi(x)\in p(x)\) and \(\phi(x)\not\in q(x)\). Since they are
   maximally consistent, \(q(x)\vDash\neg\phi(x)\) hence \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) cannot be realised by the same
   element. So we may assume that \(T\) has infinite
   models

   If all types can be realised in a single countable model, there can be at most countably many
   types.

   if conversely all \(S_{n+1}(T)\) are at most countable, then over any \(n\)-element subset of a
   model of \(T\) there are at most countably many types. We construct an elementary chain
   \begin{equation*}
   \fA_0\prec\fA_1\prec\dots
   \end{equation*}
   of models of \(T\). For \(\fA_0\) we take any countable model. if \(\fA_i\) is already constructed, we
   use Corollary ref:cor2.2.9 and Theorem ref:thm2.3.1 to construct a countable model \(\fA_{i+1}\) in
   such a way that all types over finite subsets of \(A_i\) are realised in \(\fA_{i+1}\). This can be
   done since there are only countable many such types. The union \(\fA=\bigcup_{i\in\omega}\fA_i\) is countable
   and \(\omega\)-saturated since every type over a finite subset \(B\) of \(\fA\) is realised

   We can assume that \(T\) is small and not \(\aleph_0\)-categorical (if \(T\) is not small, then it has
   no countable model). We will show that \(T\) has at
   least three non-isomorphic countable models. First, \(T\) has an \(\omega\)-saturated countable
   model \(\fA\) and there is a non-isolated type \(p(\barx)\) which can be omitted in a countable
   model \(\fB\). Let \(p(\barx)\) be realised in \(\fA\) by \(\bara\). Since \(\Th(\fA,\bara)\) is
   not \(\aleph_0\)-categorical as \(T\subset\Th(\fA,\bara)\), \(\Th(\fA,\bara)\) has a countable model \((\fC,\barc)\) which is not
   \omega-saturated. Then \(\fC\) is not \omega-saturated and therefore not isomorphic to \(\fA\). But \(\fC\)
   realises \(p(\barx)\) and is therefore not isomorphic to \(\fB\)

    Let \(\fM\) and \(\fN\) be countable \(L\)-structures with the same skeleton \(\calk\), and assume

    If \(f_1:\fA\to\fN\) is an embedding of a finitely-generated substructure of \(\fA\) of \(\fM\) into \(\fN\),

       in this case, \(\fM\) is unique up to isomorphism and is called the Fraïssé limit of \(\calk\)
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Let \(\calk\) be the skeleton of a countably \(\calk\)-saturated structure \(\fM\). Clearly, \(\calk\) has the
    hereditary property (substructure of a substructure is still a substructure).  To see that \(\calk\)
    has the Amalgamation Property, let \(\fA,\fB_0,\fB_1,f_0\) and \(f_1\) be as in 3. We may assume
    that \(\fB_0\subseteq\fM\) and \(f_0\) is the inclusion map. Furthermore we can assume \(\fA\subseteq\fB_1\) and
    that \(f_1\) is the inclusion map. Now the embedding \(g_1:\fB_1\to\fM\) is the extension of the
    isomorphism \(f_0:\fA\to f_0(\fA)\) to \(\fB_1\) and satisfies \(f_0=g_1\circ f_1\). For \(\fD\) we choose a
    finitely-generated substructure of \(\fM\) which contains \(\fB_0\) and the image of \(g_1\).
    For \(g_0:\fB_0\to\fD\) take the inclusion map. For Joint Embedding Property take \(\la B_0B_1\ra^{\fM}\)

    For the converse assume that \(\calk\) has properties 1, 2 and 3. Choose an
    enumeration \((\fB_i)_{i\in\omega}\) of all isomorphism types in \(\calk\) (they are not isomorphic). We
    construct \(\fM\) as the union of
    an ascending chain
    \begin{equation*}
    \fM_0\subseteq\fM_1\subseteq\dots\subseteq\fM
    \end{equation*}
    of elements of \(\calk\). Suppose that \(\fM_i\) is already constructed. If \(i=2n\), we
    choose \(\fM_{i+1}\) as the top of a diagram
    \begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
    &\fM_{i+1}\\
    \fM_i\ar[ur,"g_0"]&&\fB_n\ar[lu,"g_1"']
    \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
    where we can assume that \(g_0\) is the inclusion map. if \(i=2n+1\), let \(\fA\) and \(\fB\)
    from \(\calk\) and two embeddings \(f_0:\fA\to\fM_i\) and \(f_1:\fA\to\fB\) be given.
    \begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
    &\fM_{i+1}\\
    \fM_i\ar[ur,"g_0"]&&\fB\ar[ul,"g_1"']\\
    &\fA\ar[ul,"f_0"]\ar[ru,"f_1"']
    \end{tikzcd}\end{center}
    To ensure that \(\fM\) is \(\calk\)-saturated we have in the odd steps to make the right choice
    of \(\fA,\fB,f_0\) and \(f_1\). Assume that we have \(\fA,\fB\in\calk\) and embeddings \(f_0:\fA\to\fM\)
    and \(f_1:\fA\to\fB\). For large \(j\) the image of \(f_0\) will be contained in \(\fM_j\). During the
    construction of the \(\fM_i\), in order to guarantee the \(\calk\)-saturation of \(\fM\), we have to
    ensure that eventually, for some odd \(i\ge j\), the embeddings \(f_0:\fA\to\fM_i\) and \(f_1:\fA\to\fB\) were
    used in the construction of \(\fM_{i+1}\). This can be done since for each \(j\) there are - up to
    isomorphism - at most countably many possibilities. Thus there exists an
    embedding \(g_1:\fB\to\fM_{i+1}\) with \(f_0=g_1\circ f_1\).

    \(\calk\) is the skeleton of \(\fM\): the finitely-generated substructure are the substructures of
    the \(\fM_1\). Since \(\fM_i\in\calk\), their finitely-generated substructure also belong to \(\calk\). On the
    other hand each \(B_n\) is isomorphic to a substructure of \(\fM_{2n+1}\)

    Uniqueness follows from Theorem ref:thm4.4.2

    existential formula \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\exists y\rho(x_1,\dots,x_n,y)\) is, modulo \(T\), equivalent to a
    quantifier-free formula. Let \(r_1(\barx),\dots,r_{k-1}(\barx)\) be the quantifier-free types of

    As just noted, a prime model has to be countable and atomic.

    Let \(\fM_0\) be a countable and atomic model of \(T\) and \(\fM\) any model of \(T\). We construct

    maps

    f:A\to B
    \end{equation*}
    between finite subsets \(A\) of \(M_0\) and \(B\) of \(M\). The empty map is elementary
    since \(T\) is complete and \(\fM_0\equiv\fM\)

    We show that \(f\) can be extended to any given \(A\cup\{a\}\). Let \(p(x)=\tp(a/A)\)
    and \(f(p)=f(p(x))\). We show that \(f(p)\) has a realisation \(b\in M\)

    Let \(\bara\) be a tuple which enumerates the elements of \(A\) and \(\varphi(x,\barx)\)
    an \(L\)-formula which isolates the \(\tp(a\bara)\) since \(\fM_0\) is atomic. Then \(p(x)\) is
    isolated by \(\varphi(x,\bara)\): clearly \(\varphi(x,\bara)\in\tp(a/\bara)\) and
    if \(\rho(x,\bara)\in\tp(a/\bara)\) we have  \(\rho(x,y)\in\tp(a,\bara)\). This implies
    that \(\fM_0\vDash\forall x(\varphi(x,\bara)\to\rho(x,\bara))\) and \(\fM\vDash\forall x(\varphi(x,f(\bara))\to\rho(x,f(\bara)))\). Thus \(f(p)\) is

    Let \(I\) be a linear order and \(\fA\) an \(L\)-structure. A family \((a_i)_{i\in I}\) of elements

    if two of the \(a_i\) are equal, all \(a_i\) are the same. Therefore it is often assumed that

    Let \(A\) be infinite and \(n\in\omega\). Partition the set of \(n\)-elements subsets \([A]^n\) into
    subsets \(C_1,\dots,C_k\). Then there is an infinite subset of \(A\) whose \(n\)-element subsets all
    belong to the same subset \(C_i\)
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Thinking of the partition as a colouring on \([A]^n\), we are looking for an infinite
    subset \(B\) of \(A\) s.t. \([B]^n\) is monochromatic. We prove the theorem by induction
    on \(n\). For \(n=1\), the statement is evident from the pigeonhole principle since there are
    infinite elements and finite colors.

    Assuming the theorem is true for \(n\), we now prove it for \(n+1\). Let \(a_0\in A\). Then any
    colouring of \([A]^{n+1}\) induces a colouring of the \(n\)-element subsets of \(A'=A\setminus\{a_0\}\):
    just colour \(x\in[A']^n\) by the colour of \(\{a_0\}\cup x\in[A]^{n+1}\). By the induction hypothesis,
    there exists an infinite monochromatic subset \(B_1\) of \(A'\) in the induced colouring. Thus,
    all the \((n+1)\)-element subsets of \(A\) consisting of \(a_0\) and \(n\) elements of \(B_1\)
    have the same colour but \(\{a_0\}\cup B\) is not our desired set.

    Now pick any \(a_1\in B_1\). By the same argument we obtain an infinite
    subset \(B_2\subseteq B_1\) with the same properties. We thus construct an infinite
    sequence \(A=B_0\supset B_1\supset B_2\supset\dots\) and elements \(a_i\in B_i\setminus B_{i+1}\) s.t.
    the colour of each \((n+1)\)-element subset \(\{a_{i(0)},\dots,a_{i(n)}\}\) with \(i(0)<i(1)<\dots<i(n)\)
    depends only on the value of \(i(0)\).
    \begin{equation*}
    a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,\dots
    \end{equation*}
    Again by the pigeonhole principle there are infinitely
    many values of \(i(0)\) for which this colour will be the same and we take \(\{a_{i(0)}\}\).
    These \(a_{i(0)}\) then yields
    the desired monochromatic set.

    Choose a set \(C\) of new constants with an ordering isomorphic to \(J\). Consider the theories

    T''&=\{\varphi(\barc)\leftrightarrow\varphi(\bard)\mid\barc,\bard\in C\}
    \end{align*}
    Here the \(\varphi(\barx)\) are \(L\)-formulas and \(\barc,\bard\) tuples in increasing order. We have
    to show that \(T\cup T'\cup T''\) is consistent. It is enough to show that
    \begin{equation*}
    T_{C_0,\Delta}=T\cup\{\varphi(\barc)\in T'\mid\barc\in C_0\}\cup\{\varphi(\barc)\leftrightarrow\varphi(\bard)\mid\varphi(\barx)\in\Delta,\barc,\bard\in C_0\}
    \end{equation*}
    is consistent for finite sets \(C_0\) and \Delta. Note that \(\Diag_{\el}(\fM)\subseteq T\).
    We can assume that the elements of \Delta are formulas
    with free variables \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) and that all tuples \(\barc\) and \(\bard\) have the same
    length

    for notational simplicity we assume that all \(a_i\) are different. So we may
    consider \(A=\{a_i\mid i\in I\}\) as an ordered set, which is the interpretation of \(C\). We define an
    equivalence relation on \([A]^n\) by
    \begin{equation*}
    \bara\sim\barb\Longleftrightarrow\fM\vDash\varphi(\bara)\leftrightarrow\varphi(\barb)\text{ for all }\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\Delta
    \end{equation*}
    where \(\bara,\barb\) are tuples in increasing order. Since this equivalence has at
    most \(2^{\abs{\Delta}}\) many classes, by Ramsey's Theorem there is an infinite subset \(B\subseteq A\) with
    all \(n\)-element subsets in the same equivalence class. We interpret the constants \(c\in C_0\)
    by elements \(b_c\) in \(B\) ordered in the same way as the \(c\). Then \((\fM,b_c)_{c\in C_0}\) is
    a model of \(T_{C_0,\Delta}\).

    countable subset of \(M\)
    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    <<BIG Problem>>: need more time to think

    If \(A=\{a_i\mid i\in I\}\), then every element \(b\in M\) has the form \(b=t(\bara)\), where \(t\) is
    an \(L\)-term and \(\bara\) is a tuple from \(A\) since \(\fM\) is generated by \((a_i)\)

    Consider a countable subset \(S\) of \(M\). Write
    \begin{equation*}
    S=\{t_n^{\calm}(\bara^n)\mid n\in\omega\}
    \end{equation*}
    Let \(A_0=\{a_i\mid i\in I_0\}\) be the (countable) set of elements of \(A\) which occur in
    the \(\bara^n\). Then every type \(\tp(b/S)\) is determined by \(\tp(b/A_0)\) since
    every \(L(S)\)-formula
    \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(x,t_{n_1}^{\calm}(\bara^{n}),\dots)
    \end{equation*}
    can be replaced by the \(L(A_0)\)-formula \(\varphi(x,t_{n_1}(\bara^{n_1}),\dots)\)

    \(\tp(b/A_0)=\tp(t(\bara)/A_0)=\{\varphi(\barx)\; \call_{A_0}\text{-formula}: \fM\vDash\varphi(t(\bara))\}\).

    Now the type of \(b=t(\bara)\) over \(A_0\) depends only on \(t(\barx)\) (countably many
    possibilities) and the type \(\tp(\bara/A_0)\) (really?). Write \(\bara=a_{\bari}\) for a tuple \(\bari\)
    from \(I\). _Since the \(a_i\) are indiscernible, the type depends only on_
    _the quantifier-free type \(\tp_{\qf}(\bari/I_0)\) in the structure \((I,<)\)_ since it has
    quantifier elimination. This type again depends on \(\tp_{\qf}(\bari)\) (finitely many
    possibilities) and on the types  \(p(x)=\tp_{\qf}(i/I_0)\) of the elements \(i\) (Note the
    quantifier elimination, then we only need to Booleanly combine these things to get \(\tp_{\qf}(\bari/I_0)\))
    of \(\bari\). There are three kinds of such types:
    1. \(i\) is bigger than all elements of \(I_0\)
    2. \(i\) is an element \(i_0\) of \(I_0\)
    3. For some \(i_0\in I_0\), \(i\) is smaller than \(i_0\) but bigger than all elements
       of \(\{j\in I_0\mid j<i_0\}\)


    There is only one type in the first case, in the other case the type is determined by \(i_0\).
    This results in countably many possibilities for each component of \(\bari\)

      So assume that \varphi is big. Since each thin formula belongs to at most \kappa types and since there
      are at most \kappa formulas, there are at most \kappa types which contain thin formulas. Therefore
      \varphi belongs to two distinct types \(p\) and \(q\) which contain only big formulas. If we

   If \(T\) is \kappa-stable, then for all regular \(\lambda\le\kappa\), there is a model of cardinality \kappa which is \lambda-saturated
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   By Exercise ref:ex5.2.6 we may assume that \(\abs{T}\le\kappa\).  Consider a model \(\fM\) of cardinality
   \kappa. Since \(S(M_\alpha)\) has cardinality \kappa, Corollary ref:cor2.2.9 and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem
   give an elementary extension of cardinality \kappa in which all types over \(\fM\) are realised. So can
   construct a continuous elementary chain
   \begin{equation*}
   \fM_0\prec\fM_1\prec\dots\prec\fM_\alpha\prec\cdots(\alpha<\lambda)
   \end{equation*}
   of models of \(T\) with cardinality \kappa s.t. all \(p\in S(M_\alpha)\) are realised in \(\fM_{\alpha+1}\).
   Then \(\fM\) is \lambda-saturated. In fact, if \(\abs{A}<\lambda\) and if \(a\in A\) is contained in \(M_{\alpha(a)}\)
   then \(\Lambda=\bigcup_{a\in A}\alpha(a)\) is an initial segment of \lambda of smaller cardinality than \lambda. So \Lambda has an
   upper bound \(\mu<\lambda\). It follows that \(A\subseteq\fM_\mu\) and all types over \(A\) are realised in \(\fM_{\mu+1}\)

    Clearly \(A\) is contained in \(A_\lambda\). We show that \(A_\lambda\) is the universe of an elementary

    an isolated \(p(x)\in S(A_\lambda)\) containing \(\varphi(x)\). Let \(b\) be a realisation of \(p(x)\)
    in \(\fM\). We can prolong our construction by \(a_\lambda=b\); thus \(b\in A_\lambda\) by maximality

    Now conversely, assume that \(\rho(x,b)\) isolates \(\tp(a/b)\) and that \(\sigma(y)\)
    isolates \(p(y)=\tp(b)\). Then \(\rho(x,y)\wedge\sigma(y)\) isolates. Firstly, \(\rho(x,y)\wedge\sigma(y)\in\tp(a,b)\).

    is omitted in \(\fM\).
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    We call an \(L(M)\)-formula *large* if its realisation set \(\varphi(\fM)\) is uncountable. Since there is
    no infinite binary tree of large formulas, there exists a *minimal* large formula
    \(\varphi_0(x)\) in the sense that for every \(L(M)\)-formula \(\psi(x)\) either \(\varphi_0(x)\wedge\psi(x)\)
    or \(\varphi_0(x)\wedge\neg\psi(x)\) is at most countable. Now it's easy to see that
    \begin{equation*}
    p(x)=\{\psi(x)\mid\varphi_0(x)\wedge\psi(x)\text{ large}\}
    \end{equation*}
    is a type in \(S(M)\).
    #+LATEX: \wu{
    For any formula \psi, if \(\varphi(\fM)=(\varphi(\fM)\wedge\psi(\fM))\cup(\varphi(\fM)\wedge\neg\psi(\fM))\). So exactly one of it belongs to \(p(x)\).
    #+LATEX: }

    Clearly \(p(x)\) contains no formula of the form \(x\dot{=}a\) for \(a\in M\), so \(p(x)\) is not
    realised in \(M\). On the other hand, every countable subset \(\Pi(x)\subseteq p(x)\) is realised
    in \(\fM\): since \(\varphi_0(\fM)\setminus\psi(\fM)=\varphi_0(\fM)\wedge\neg\psi(\fM)\) is at most countable for every \(\psi(x)\in\Pi(x)\), the
    elements of \(\varphi_0(\fM)\) which do not belong to the union of these sets realised \(\Pi(x)\).

    Let \(a\) be a realisation of \(p(x)\) in a (proper) elementary extension \(\fN\). By Theorem
    ref:thm5.3.3, we can assume that \(\fN\) is atomic over \(\fM\cup\{a\}\).

    Fix \(b\in N\). We have to show that every countable subset \(\Sigma(y)\subset\tp(b/M)\) is realised
    in \(M\).

    Let \(\chi(x,y)\) be an \(L(M)\)-formula s.t. \(\chi(a,y)\) isolates \(q(y)=\tp(b/M\cup\{a\})\). If \(b\)
    realised an \(L(M)\)-formula \(\sigma(y)\), we have \(\fN\vDash\forall y(\chi(a,y)\to\sigma(y))\). Hence the formula
    \begin{equation*}
    \sigma^*(x)=\forall y(\chi(x,y)\to\sigma(y))
    \end{equation*}
    belongs to \(p(x)\). Note that \(\exists y\chi(x,y)\) belongs also to \(p(x)\).

    Choose an element \(a'\in M\) which satisfies
    \begin{equation*}
    \{\sigma^*(x)\mid\sigma\in\Sigma\}\cup\{\exists y\chi(x,y)\}
    \end{equation*}
    and choose \(b'\in M\) with \(\fM\vDash\chi(a',b')\). Since \(\fM\vDash\sigma^*(a')\), \(\fM\vDash\sigma(b')\). So \(b'\)
    realises \(\Sigma(y)\).

    We have shown that \(\fM\) has a proper elementary extension which realises no new countable set
    of \(L(M)\)-formulas. By iteration we obtain arbitrarily long chains of elementary extensions
    with the same property

    Suppose that the Vaughtian pair is witnessed (in certain models) by some formula \(\varphi(x)\). For
    simplicity we assume that \(\varphi(x)\) does not contain parameters (see Exercise ref:ex5.5.4).
    Let \(P\) be a new unary predicate. It is easy to find an \(L(P)\)-theory \(T_{\text{VP}}\) whose
    models \((\fN,M)\) consist of a model \(\fN\vDash T\) and a subset \(M\) defined by the new
    predicate \(P\) which is the universe of an elementary substructure \(\fM\) which together
    with \(\fN\) forms a Vaughtian pair for \(\varphi(x)\).
    #+LATEX: \wu{
    As in Marker's p152. Let \(\fM\) be the elementary substructure of \(\fN\) by Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem .
    #+LATEX: }
    The Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem applied to \(T_{\text{VP}}\) yields a Vaughtian pair \(\fM_0\prec\fN_0\)
    for \(\varphi(x)\) with \(\fM_0,\fN_0\)  countable

    We first construct an elementary chain
    \begin{equation*}
    (\fN_0,M_0)\prec(\fN_1,M_1)\prec\cdots
    \end{equation*}
    of countable Vaughtian pairs, with the aim that both components of the union pair
    \begin{equation*}
    (\fN,M)
    \end{equation*}
    are \omega-homogeneous and realise the same \(n\)-types. If \((\fN_i,M_i)\) is given, we first choose a
    countable elementary extension \((\fN',M')\) s.t. \(\fM'\) realises all \(n\)-types which are
    realised in \(\fN_i\).
    #+LATEX: \wu{
    Add \(N_i\) to language and add all \(\tp^P_n(\barn)\) to \(T_{\text{VP}}\).
    #+LATEX: }
    Then we choose as in the proof of Lemma
    ref:lemma5.5.3 a countable elementary extension \((\fN_{i+1},\fM_{i+1})\) of \((\fN',M')\) for
    which \(\fN_{i+1}\) and \(\fM_{i+1}\) are \omega-homogeneous

    It follows from Lemma ref:lemma5.5.3 (3) that \(\fM\) and \(\fN\) are isomorphic.

    Next we construct a continuous elementary chain
    \begin{equation*}
    \fM^0\prec\fM^1\prec\cdots\prec\fM^\alpha\prec\cdots\quad(\alpha<\omega_1)
    \end{equation*}
    with \((\fM^{\alpha+1},\fM^\alpha)\cong(\fN,M)\) for all \alpha. We start with \(\fM^0=\fM\). If \(\fM^\alpha\) is constructed, we
    choose an isomorphism \(\fM\to\fM^\alpha\) and extend it to an isomorphism \(\fN\to\fM^{\alpha+1}\) (Lemma
    ref:lemma1.1.8). For a countable limit ordinal \lambda, \(\fM^\lambda\) is the union of the \(\fM^\alpha\) (\(\alpha<\lambda\)).
    So \(\fM^\lambda\) is isomorphic to \(\fM\) by Lemma ref:lemma5.5.3 (2) and ref:lemma5.5.3 (3)

    Finally we set
    \begin{equation*}
    \barfM=\bigcup_{\alpha<\omega_1}\fM^\alpha
    \end{equation*}
    \(\barfM\) has cardinality \(\aleph_1\) while \(\varphi(\barfM)=\varphi(\fM^\alpha)=\varphi(\fM^0)\).
    #+LATEX: \wu{
    If \(\barfM\vDash\varphi(\bara)\), then  there is some \(\alpha<\omega_1\) s.t. \(\bara\in M^\alpha\cong M^0\).

** Algebraic formulas
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    Let \(\fM\) be a structure and \(A\) a subset of \(M\). A formula \(\varphi(x)\in L(A)\) is called
    *algebraic* if \(\varphi(\fM)\) is finite. An element \(a\in M\) is algebraic over \(A\) if it realizes an
    algebraic \(L(A)\)-formula. We call an element algebraic if it is algebraic over the empty set.
    The *algebraic closure* of \(A\), \(\acl(A)\), is the set of all elements of \(\fM\) algebraic
    over \(A\), and \(A\) is called *algebraically closed* if it equals its algebraic closure
    #+END_definition

    #+BEGIN_remark
    Note that the algebraic closure of \(A\) does not grow in elementary extensions of \(\fM\) because
    an \(L(A)\)-formula which defines a finite set in \(\fM\) defines the same set in every elementary
    extension
    #+LATEX: \wu{
    We can express there are exactly \(m\) solutions in formula.
    #+LATEX: }

    By Theorem ref:thm2.3.1
    \begin{equation*}
    \abs{\acl(A)}\le\max(\abs{T},\abs{A})
    \end{equation*}
   In algebraically closed fields, an element \(a\) is algebraic over \(A\) precisely if \(a\) is
   algebraic (in the field-theoretical sense) over the field generated by \(A\). This follows from
   quantifier elimination in \(\ACF\)

   We call a type \(p(x)\in S(A)\) algebraic iff \(p\) contains an algebraic formula. Any algebraic
   type \(p\) is isolated by an algebraic formula \(\varphi(x)\in L(A)\), namely by any \(\varphi\in p\) having the
   minimal number of solutions in \(\fM\).
   #+LATEX: \wu{
   If \varphi has \(m\) solutions and \psi has \(n\) (\(n>m\)) solutions, then \(\varphi\to\psi\) as they are consistent.
   #+LATEX: }
   This number is called the *degree* \(\deg(p)\) of \(p\). As isolated types are realised in every
   model, the algebraic types over \(A\) are exactly of the form \(\tp(a/A)\) where \(a\) is
   algebraic over \(A\). The *degree* of \(a\) over \(A\) \(\deg(a/A)\) is the degree of \(\tp(a/A)\).

    Existence of non-algebraic extensions follows from Lemma ref:lemma5.6.2, which also allows us to

    minimal, there is a strongly minimal formula \(\phi(x)\in p(x)\). For any \(\fM\vDash\psi(a)\),

    The same proof shows that algebraic closure defines a pregeometry on the set of realizations of
    a /minimal/ type, i.e., a non-algebraic type \(p\in S_1(A)\) having a unique non-algebraic extension
    to all supersets \(B\) of \(A\) in elementary extensions of \(\fM\). Here is an example to show
    that a minimal type need not be strongly minimal

    Let \(T\) be the theory of \(\fM=(M,P_i)_{i<\omega}\) in which the \(P_i\) form a proper descending
    sequence of subsets. The type \(p=\{x\in P_i\mid i<\omega\}\in S_1(\emptyset)\) is minimal. If all \(P_{i+1}\) are
    coinfinite in \(P_i\), then \(p\) does not contain a minimal formula and is not strongly minimal

    In pregeometries there is a natural notion of independence and dimension, so in light of Theorem
    ref:thm5.7.5 , we may define the following

    If \(\varphi(x)\) is strongly minimal without parameters, the *\varphi-dimension* of a model \(\fM\)
    of \(T\) is the dimension of the pregeometry \((\varphi(\fM),\cl)\)
    \begin{equation*}
    \dim_\varphi(\fM)
    \end{equation*}
    If \(\fM\) is the model of a strongly minimal theory, we just write \(\dim(\fM)\)

    If \(\varphi(x)\) is defined over \(A_0\subseteq M\), the closure operator of the pregeometry \(\varphi(\fM_{A_0})\)
    is given by
    \begin{equation*}
    \cl(A)=\acl^M(A_0\cup A)\cap\varphi(\fM)
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
    \dim_\varphi(\fM/A_0):=\dim_{\varphi}(\fM_{A_0})
    \end{equation*}
    is called the \varphi-dimension of \(\fM\) over \(A_0\).

    *Claim*. Every infinite algebraically closed subset \(S\) of \(M\) is the universe of an
     elementary substructure

     /Proof/. By Theorem ref:thm2.1.2 it suffices to show that every
     consistent \(L(S)\)-formula \(\varphi(x)\) can be realised in \(S\). If \(\varphi(\fM)\) is finite, all
     realisations are algebraic over \(S\) and belong to \(S\). If \(\varphi(\fM)\) is cofinite, \(\varphi(\fM)\)
     meets all infinite sets.

     Let \(A\) be a finite subset of \(\fM\) and \(p\) the non-algebraic type in \(S(A)\).
     #+LATEX: \wu{
     Suppose there are i guess. Since all algebraic types are isolated.

     Note that for any \(\varphi\in p\), \(\varphi(\fM)\) is cofinite. If \(p\) is not realised,

     i.e., iff \(\dim(\fM)>\dim(A)\). Since
     all algebraic types over \(A\) are always realised in \(\fM\), this shows that \(\fM\) is

    For the other direction we first obtain a strongly minimal formula: since \(T\) is totally

    ref:thm4.5.9 or from Theorem ref:thm5.3.3) Let \(\varphi(x)\) be a minimal formula in \(L(M_0)\),

    eliminated by Lemma ref:lemma5.5.7 and hence \(\varphi(x)\) is strongly minimal by Lemma
    ref:lemma5.7.2.

    Let \(\fM_1,\fM_2\) be models of cardinality \kappa. We may assume that \(\fM_0\) is an elementary submodel

    #+LATEX: \wu{
