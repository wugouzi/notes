* Preliminaries
** \(M^{\eq}\) and strong types
    We give a construction that allows to treat definable sets and quotient objects in the same way
    as elements of the structure

    We start with an arbitrary \(L\)-structure \(M\) with \(\Th(M)=T\). Let \(\ER(T)\) be the
    collection of all \(L\)-formulas \(E(x,y)\) that define an equivalence relation on a certain
    tuple of sorts in \(M\) (i.e., we have a definable relation \(E(x_1,\dots,x_n;x_1',\dots,x_n')\)
    and \(x_i,x_i'\) live on the same sort of \(M\), for each \(i\)).  We define a new
    language \(L^{\eq}:=L\cup\{S_E:E\in\ER(T)\}\cup\{f_E:E\in\ER(T)\}\), where \(S_E\) is a sort and \(f_E\) is a
    new function symbol from the sort on which \(E\) lives into the new sort \(S_E\). In particular,
    for every sort \(S\) of \(M\) there is a corresponding sort \(S_=\), where = is the equality on
    the sort \(S\), and all the \(L\)-structure on it. Note that \(\abs{L}=\abs{L^{\eq}}\)

    We now enlarge \(M\) to a canonical \(L^{\eq}\)-structure \(M^{\eq}\). The sorts
    \begin{equation*}
    (S_=:S\text{ is a sort of $M$})
    \end{equation*}
    and all the \(L\)-structure on them is identified with \(M\), the sort \(S_E\) in \(M^{\eq}\) is
    given by the set \(\{a/E:a\in M_x\}\), and the function \(f_E\) is interpreted by \(a\mapsto a/E\). With
    this identification we clearly have that for all \(M\vDash T\), \(\phi(x)\in L\) and \(a\in M_x\),
    \(M\vDash\phi(a)\Leftrightarrow M^{\eq}\vDash\phi(a)\)

    We define the \(L^{\eq}\)-theory
