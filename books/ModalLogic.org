** Modal Languages

   #+BEGIN_definition
    The *basic modal language* is defined using  a set of *proposition letters* \Phi
    whose elements are usually denoted \(p,q,r\) and so on, and a unary modal
    operator \(\lozenge\). The well-formed *formulas* \phi of the basic modal
    language are given by the rule
   \begin{equation*}
   \phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\psi\vee\phi\mid\lozenge\phi
   \end{equation*}

   A *modal similarity type* is a pair \(\tau=(O,\rho)\) where \(O\) is a non-empty
   set, and \rho is a function \(O\to\N\). The elements of \(O\) are called *modal
   operators*; we use \(\triangle\), \(\triangle_0,\triangle_1,\dots\) to denote
   elements of \(O\). The function \rho assigns to each operator \(\delta\in O\) a
   finite *arity*
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A *modal language* \(ML(\tau,\Phi)\) is built up using a modal similarity type
   \(\tau=(O,\rho)\) and a set of proposition letters \Phi. The set \(Form(\tau,\Phi)\) of
   *modal formulas* over \tau and \Phi is given by the rule
   \begin{equation*}
   \phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi_1\vee\phi_2\mid\triangle(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_{\rho(\triangle)})
   \end{equation*}
   where \(p\) ranges over elements of \Phi
   #+END_definition

   #+BEGIN_definition
   For each \(\triangle\in O\) the *dual* \(\triangledown\) of \(\triangle\) is defined
   as \(\triangledown(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n):=\neg\triangle(\neg\phi_1,\dots,\neg\phi_n)\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [The Basic Temporal Language]
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   The basic temporal language is built using a set of unary operators \(O=\{\la
   F\ra,\la P\ra\}\). The intended interpretation of a formula \(\la F\ra\phi\)
   is ' \phi will be true at some Future time' and the intended interpretation of
   \(\la P\ra\phi\) is ' \phi was true at some Past time.' This language is called
   the *basic temporal language*. Their duals are written as \(G\) and \(H\) ('it
   is Going to be the case' and 'it always Has been the case')

   Let's denote the converse of a relation \(R\) by \(R^\smallsmile\). We will
   call a frame of the form \((T,R,R^\smallsmile)\) a *bidirectional frame*, and a
   model built over such a frame a *bidirectional model*. From now on, we will
   only interpret basic temporal language in bidirectional models. That is, if
   \(\fM=(T,R,R^\smallsmile,V)\) is a bidirectional model then
   \begin{align*}
   \fM,t\Vdash F\phi \quad&\text{ iff }\quad
   \exists s(Rts\wedge \fM,s\Vdash\phi)\\
   \fM,t\Vdash P\phi \quad&\text{ iff }\quad
   \exists s(R^\smallsmile ts\wedge \fM,s\Vdash\phi)
   \end{align*}
   #+END_examplle

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Propositional Dynamic Logic]
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   Each of these diamonds has the form \(\la\pi\ra\), where \pi denotes a
   (non-deterministic) *program*. The intended interpretation of \(\la\pi\ra\) is
   'some terminating execution of \pi from the present state leas to a state
   bearing the information \phi '. The dual assertion \([\pi]\phi\) states that
   'every execution of \pi from the present state leads to a state bearing the
   information \phi '

   Suppose we have fixed some set of basic programs \(a,b,c\) and so on. Then we
   are allowed to define complex programs \pi over this base as follows
   1. *Choice*. If \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are programs, then so is \(\pi_1\cup\pi_2\)
   2. *Composition*. so is \(\pi_1;\pi_2\)
   3. *Iteration*. so is \(\pi^*\)


   This is called *regular* PDL. There are also
   1. *Intersection* if \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are programs, then so is
      \(\pi_1\cap\pi_2\)

      execute both \(\pi_1,\pi_2\), in parallel

   2. *test* if \phi is a formula, then so is \(\phi?\)

      test whether \phi holds, and if so, continues; if not, it fails
   
   The language of PDL has an infinite collection of diamonds, each indexed by a
   program \pi build from basic programs using the constructor \(\cup,;\) and
   \(^*\).
   \begin{align*}
    &R_{\pi_1\cup\pi_2}=R_{\pi_1}\cup R_{\pi_2}\\
    &R_{\pi_1;\pi_2}=R_{\pi_1}\circ R_{\pi_2}\\
    &R_{\pi_1^*}=(R_{\pi_1})^*
    \end{align*}

   Suppose  we have fixed a set of basic programs. Let \Pi be the set of programs
   containing the basic programs and all the programs constructed over them
   using the regular constructors \(\cup,;,^*\). Then a *regular frame for* \Pi is
   a labeled transitive system \((W,\{R_\pi\mid\pi\in\Pi\})\) s..t \(R_a\) is an
   arbitrary binary  relation for each basic program \(a\), and for all complex
   programs \pi, \(R_{\pi}\) is the binary relation inductively constructed in
   accordance with the previous clauses. A *regular model* for \Pi is a model built
   over a regular frame.

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [An Arrow Language]
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   The type \(\tau_\to\) of *arrow logic* is a similarity type with modal
   operators other than diamonds. The language of arrow logic is designed to
   talk about the objects in arrow structures. The well-formed formulas \phi are
   given by
   \begin{equation*}
   \phi:=p\mid\bot\mid\neg\phi\mid\phi\vee\psi\mid\phi\circ\psi\mid
   \otimes\phi\mid 1'
   \end{equation*}
   1' ('identity') is a nullary modality, the 'converse' operator \(\otimes\) is
   a diamond, and the 'composition' operator \(\circ\) is a dyadic operator.
   Possible readings of these operators are:
   \begin{alignat*}{3}
   &1'&&\text{identity}&&\text{'skip'}\\
   &\otimes\phi&&\text{converse}&&\text{'\(\phi\) conversely'}\\
   &\phi\circ\psi\quad&&\text{composition}\quad&&\text{'first \(\phi\), then \(\psi\)'}
   \end{alignat*}

   A *frame* for the basic modal language is a pair \(\fF=(W,R)\) s.t.
   1. \(W\) is a non-empty set
   2. \(R\) is a binary relation on \(W\)


   A *model* for the basic modal language is a pair \(\fM=(\fF,V)\), where \(\fF\)
   is a frame for the basic modal language and \(V\) is a function assigning to
   each proposition letter \(p\) in \Phi a subset \(V(p)\) of \(W\). The function
   \(V\) is called a *valuation*. \(\fM\) is *based on* the frame \(\fF\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Suppose \(w\) is a state in a model \(\fM=(W,R,V)\). Then \phi is *satisfied* in
   \(\fM\) at state \(w\) if
   \begin{align*}
   \fM,w\Vdash p&\quad\text{iff}\quad
   w\in V(p),\text{ where } p\in\Phi\\
   \fM,w\Vdash\bot&\quad\text{iff}\quad\text{never}\\

   \text{ for some }v\in W\text{ with }Rwv\text{ we have }\fM,v\Vdash\phi
   \end{align*}
   It follows that \(\fM,w\Vdash\Box\phi\) iff for all \(v\in W\) s.t.
   \(Rwv\), we have \(\fM,v\Vdash\phi\)

   Let \tau be a modal similarity type. A *\(\tau\)-frame* is a tuple \(\fF\)
   consisting of the following ingredients
   1. a non-empty set \(W\)
   2. for each \(n\ge0\), and each \(n\)-ary modal operator \(\triangle\) in the
      similarity type \tau, an \((n+1)\)-ary relation \(R_{\triangle}\)
   #+END_definition

   \phi is *satisfied at a state \(w\)* in a model
   \(\fM=(W,\{R_{\triangle}\mid\triangle\in\tau\},V)\) when

   &\text{we have, for each }i,\fM,v_i\Vdash\phi_i
   \end{align*}

   When \(\rho(\triangle)=0\) we define

   \fM,w\Vdash\triangle \quad\text{ iff }\quad
   w\in R_{\triangle}

   Given an \((n+1)\)-ary relation \(R\) on a set \(W\), we define the following
   \(n\)-ary operation \(m_R\) on the power set \(\calp(W)\) of \(W\):
   \begin{equation*}
   m_R(X_1,\dots,X_n)=\{w\in W\mid Rww_1\dots w_n\text{ for some }
   w_1\in X_1,\dots,w_n\in X_n\}

   Let \tau be a modal similarity type. A *general \(\tau\)-frame* is a pair
   \((\fF,A)\) where \(\fF=(W,R_{\triangle})_{\triangle\in\tau}\) is a
   \(\tau\)-frame, and \(A\) is a non-empty collection of *admissible* subsets of
   \(W\) closed under following operations
   1. union: if \(X,Y\in A\), then \(X\cup Y\in A\)
   2. relative complement: if \(X\in A\), then \(W\setminus X\in A\)
   3. modal operations: if \(X_1,\dots,X_n\in A\), then
      \(m_{R_{\triangle}}(X_1,\dots,X_n)\in A\) for all \(\triangle\in\tau\)


   A *model based on a general frame* is a triple \((\fF,A,V)\) where \((\fF,A)\)
   is a general frame and \(V\) is a valuation satisfying the constraint that
   for each proposition letter \(p\), \(V(p)\) is an element of \(A\). Valuation
   satisfying this constraint are called *admissible* for \((\fF,A)\)

    Let \(\fM_3:=(\fM_2\restriction k)\). By Lemma ref:lemma2.33 we have

    By induction on \(n\le k\) we define finite sets of states \(S_0,\dots,S_k\)
    and a (final) model \(\fM_4\) with domain \(S_0\cup\cdots\cup S_k\); the
    points in each \(S_n\) will have height \(n\)

    Define \(S_0\) to be the singleton \(\{w_2\}\). Next, assume that
    \(S_0,\dots,S_n\) have already been defined. Fix an element \(v\) of
    \(S_n\). By Proposition ref:prop2.29 there are only finitely many
    non-equivalent modal formulas whose degree is at most \(k-n\), say
    \(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_m\). For each formula that is of the form \(\la
    a\ra\chi\) and holds in \(\fM_3\) at \(v\), select a state \(u\) from
    \(\fM_3\) s.t. \(R_avu\) and \(\fM_3,u\Vdash\chi\). Add all these \(u\)s to
    \(S_{n+1}\), and repeat this selection process for every state in \(S_n\).
    \(S_{n+1}\) is defined as the set of all points that have been selected in
    this way

    Finally, define \(\fM_4\) as follows. Its domain is \(S_0\cup\dots\cup
    S_k\); as each \(S_i\) is finite, \(\fM_4\) is finite. The relations and

    For example, by Theorem ref:thm2.24 the class of image-finite models has the

    \(\phi_0,\phi_0\wedge\phi_1,\phi_0\wedge\phi_1\wedge\phi_2,\dots\) hold. If

    Suppose that we are looking for a successor of \(w\) at which every formula
    \(\phi_i\) of the infinite set of formulas
    \(\Sigma=\{\phi_0,\phi_1,\dots\}\) holds. M-saturation is a kind of

    \(R'\)-successor \(v_\Delta\) s.t. \(\fM',v_\Delta\Vdash\bigwedge\Delta\).
    In other words, \Sigma is finitely satisfiable in the set of successors of

    Let \tau be a modal similarity type, and
    \(\fF=(W,R_{\triangle})_{ \triangle\in\tau}\) is a \(\tau\)-frame. The
    *ultrafilter extension* \(\fu\fe\fF\) of \(\fF\) is defined as the frame
    \((Uf(W),R_{\triangle}^{ue})_{\triangle\in\tau}\). Here \(Uf(W)\) is the set of
    ultrafilters over \(W\) and \(R_{\triangle}^{ue}u_0u_1\dots u_n\) holds for
    a tuple \(u_0,\dots,u_n\) of ultrafilters over \(W\) if we have that
    \(m_{R_{\triangle}}(X_1,\dots,X_n)\in u_0\) whenever \(X_i\in u_i\) for all
    \(i\) with \(1\le i\le n\)

    The *ultrafilter extension* of a \(\tau\)-model \(\fM=(\fF,V)\) is the model
    \(\fu\fe\fM=(\fu\fe\fF,V^{ue})\) where \(V^{ue}(p_i)\) is the set of
    ultrafilters of which \(V(p_i)\) is a member
    #+END_definition

    Any subset of a frame can be viewed as a *proposition*. A filter over the
    universe of the frame can thus be seen as a *theory*, in fact as a logically
    closed theory, since filters are both closed under intersection
    (conjunction) and upward closed (entailment). Viewed this way, a proper
    filter is a *consistent* theory, or *state of affairs*,
    for it does not contain the empty set (falsum).
    Finally an ultrafilter is a *complete* theory.

    In a given frame \(\fF\) not every state not every state of affairs needs to
    'realized', in the sense that there is a state satisfying all and only the
    propositions belonging to the state of affairs; only the states of affairs
    that correspond to the *principal* ultrafilters are realized. We build
    \(\ue\fF\) by adding every state of affairs for \(\fF\) as a new element of
    the domain - that is, \(\ue\fF\) realizes every proposition in \(\fF\)

    Stipulate that \(R^{ue}_{\triangle}u_0u_1\dots u_n\) if \(u_0\) 'sees' the
    \(n\)-tuple \(u_1,\dots,u_n\). That is, whenever \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) are
    propositions of \(u_1,\dots, u_n\) respectively, then \(u_0\) 'sees' this
    combination: that is, the proposition \(m_{R_{\triangle}}(X_1,\dots,X_n)\)
    is a member of \(u_0\).

    *Principal* ultrafilters over \(W\) plays a special role. By identifying a
    state \(w\) of a frame \(\fF\) with the principal ultrafilter
    \(\pi_w=\{X\subset W\mid w\in X\}\), it
    is easily seen that any frame \(\fF\) is (isomorphic to) a *submodel* (but in
    general not a *generated* submodel) of its ultrafilter extension. For we have
    the following equivalences
    \begin{align*}
    Rwv &\quad\text{ iff }\quad
    w\in m_R(X)\text{ for all }X\subseteq W\text{ s.t. }v\in X\\
    &\quad\text{ iff }\quad
    m_R(X)\in\pi_w\text{ for all }X\subseteq W\text{ s.t. }X\in\pi_v\\
    &\quad\text{ iff }\quad R^{ue}\pi_w\pi_v
    \end{align*}
    since

    What is the ultrafilter extension of \(\fN\)? There are two kinds of
    ultrafilter over an infinite set: the principal ultrafilter that are in
    one-to-one correspondence with the points of the set, and the non-principal
    ones which contain all co-finite sets and only infinite sets, cf Exercise
    ref:ex2.5.4. The principal ultrafilters form an isomorphic copy of the frame
    \(\fN\) inside \(\ue\fN\). For any pair \(u,u'\) of ultrafilters, if \(u'\)
    is non-principal, then \(R^{ue}uu'\). To set this, let \(X\in u'\). As
    \(X\) is infinite, for any \(n\in\N\) there is an \(m\) s.t. \(n<m\) and
    \(m\in X\). This show that \(m_<(X)=\N\). But \(\N\) is an element of every
    ultrafilter

    The shows that the ultrafilter extension of \(\fN\) consists of a copy of
    \(\fN\) followed by a uncountable cluster consisting of all the
    non-principal ultrafilters

    \(\ue\fM,u\models\phi\). Hence for every state \(w\) of \(\fM\) we have
    \(w\leftrightsquigarrow \pi_w\)
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    The second claim of the proposition is immediate from the first one by the
    observation that \(w\Vdash\phi\) iff \(w\in V(\phi)\) iff \(V(\phi)\in\pi_w\)

    Induction on \phi. The basic case is immediate from the definition of
    \(V^{ue}\). Suppose \phi is of the form \(\neg\psi\), then
    \begin{align*}
    V(\neg\psi)\in u&\quad\text{ iff }\quad
    W\setminus V(\psi)\in u\\
    &\quad\text{ iff }\quad V(\psi)\not\in u\\
    &\quad\text{ iff }\quad \ue\fM,u\not\Vdash\psi\quad\text{IH}\\
    &\quad\text{ iff }\quad \ue\fM,u\Vdash\neg\psi
    \end{align*}

    Now consider the case where \phi is of the form \(\diamond\psi\). Assume first
    that \(\ue\fM,u\Vdash\diamond\psi\). Then there is an ultrafilter \(u'\)
    s.t. \(R^{ue}uu'\) and \(\ue\fM,u'\Vdash\psi\). The induction hypothesis
    implies that \(V(\psi)\in u'\), so by the definition of \(R^{ue}\),
    \(m_R(V(\psi))\in u\). Now the result follows immediately from the observation
    that \(m_R(V(\psi))=V(\diamond\psi)\)

    Assume that \(V(\diamond\psi)\in u\). We have to find an ultrafilter \(u'\)
    s.t. \(V(\psi)\in u'\) and \(R^{ue}uu'\). The latter constraint reduces to the
    condition that \(m_R(X)\in u\) whenever \(X\in u'\), or equivalently (see
    Exercise ref:ex2.5.5)
    \begin{equation*}
    u_0':=\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}\subseteq u'
    \end{equation*}
    We will first show that \(u_0'\) is closed under intersection. Let \(Y,Z\in
    u_0'\). By definition, \(l_R(Y)\) and \(l_R(Z)\) are in \(u\). But then
    \(l_R(Y\cap Z)\in u\) as \(l_R(Y\cap Z)=l_R(Y)\cap l_R(Z)\). This proves
    that \(Y\cap Z\in u_0'\)

    Next we make sure that for any \(Y\in u_0'\), \(Y\cap V(\psi)\neq\emptyset\).
    Let \(Y\) be an arbitrary element of \(u_0'\), then by definition of
    \(u_0'\), \(l_R(Y)\in u\). As \(u\) is closed under intersection and does
    not contain the empty set, there must be an element \(x\in l_R(Y)\cap
    V(\diamond\psi)\). But then \(x\) must have a successor \(y\) in \(V(\psi)\).
    Finally, \(x\in l_R(Y)\) implies \(y\in Y\)

    From the fact that \(u_0'\) is closed under intersection, and the fact that
    for any \(Y\in u_0'\), \(Y\cap V(\psi)\neq\emptyset\), it follows that the set
    \(u_0'\cup\{V(\psi)\}\) has the finite intersection property. So the
    Ultrafilter Theorem provides us with an ultrafilter \(u'\) s.t.
    \(u_0'\cup\{V(\psi)\}\subseteq u'\). This ultrafilter \(u'\) has the desired
    properties: it is clearly a successor of \(u\), and the fact the
    \(\ue\fM,u'\Vdash\psi\) follows from \(V(\psi)\in u'\) and the induction hypothesis

    \Delta=\{V(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma'\}\cup\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}
    \end{equation*}
    where \(\Sigma'\) is the set of (finite) conjunctions of formulas in \Sigma. We
    claim that the set \Delta has the finite intersection property. Since both
    \(\{V(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma'\}\) and \(\{Y\mid l_R(Y)\in u\}\) are closed
    under taking intersections, it suffices to prove that for an arbitrary
    \(\phi\in\Sigma'\) and an arbitrary set \(Y\subseteq W\) for which
    \(l_R(Y)\in u\), we have \(V(\phi)\cap Y\neq\emptyset\). but if
    \(\phi\in\Sigma'\), then by assumption, there is a successor \(u''\) of u
    s.t. \(\ue\fM,u''\Vdash\phi\), or in other words, \(V(\phi)\in u''\). Then
    \(l_R(Y)\in u\) implies \(Y\in u''\) by Exercise ref:ex2.5.5 . Hence
    \(V(\phi)\cap Y\) is an element of the ultrafilter \(u''\) and therefore cannot
    be identical to the empty set.

    Let \(\Gamma(x)\) be a set of first-order formulas in which a single individual

    first-order model \(\fM\) *realizes* \(\Gamma(x)\) if there is an element \(w\) in
    \(\fM\) s.t. for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma,\fM\models\gamma[w]\)

    Let \(\fM\) be a model for a given first-order language \(\call^1\) with
    domain \(W\). For a subset \(A\subset W\), \(\call^1[A]\) is the language
    obtained by extending \(\call^1\) with new constant \(\underline{a}\) for
    all elements \(a\in A\). \(\fM_A\) is the expansion of \(\fM\) to a

    Assume that \(A\) is of size at most \alpha. Assume that \(\alpha=3\) and

    finitely realizable in \(\fM_A\). So for this particular set
    \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\), 3-saturation of \(\fM\) means that if
    \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is finitely realizable in \(\fM_A\), then
    \(\Gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) is realizable in \(\fM_A\)

    Or consider a formula \(\gamma(\und{a}_1,\und{a}_2,x)\) and let \(\gamma(x_1,x_2,x)\)
    be the formula with the fresh variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) replacing each

       Take a subset \(A\) of \(\Q\) and let \(\Gamma(x)\) be a set of formulas in the
       resulting expansion \(\call^1[A]\) of the first-order language that is
       consistent with the theory of \((\Q,<,a)_{a\in A}\). Then there exists a
       model \(\fN\) of the theory of \((\Q,<,a)_{a\in A}\) that realizes

       Now take a countable elementary submodel \(\fN'\) of \(\fN\) that
       contains at least one object realizing \(\Gamma(x)\). Then \(\fN'\) is a
       countable dense linear ordering without endpoints, and hence the ordering

    where \(ST_x(\Sigma)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\phi\in\Sigma\}\). \(\Sigma'\) is consistent
    with the first-order theory of \(\fM_a\): \(\fM_a\) realizes every finite
    subset of \(\Sigma'\), namely in some successor of \(a\). So by the
    countable saturation of \(\fM\), \(\Sigma'\) is realized in some state
    \(b\). By \(\fM_A\models R\und{a}x[b]\) it follows that \(b\) is a successor

    invariant for bisimulations iff it is equivalent to the standard translation
    of a modal \(\tau\)-formula
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Assume \(\alpha(x)\) is invariant for bisimulations and consider the set of modal
    consequences of \alpha:
    \begin{equation*}
    MOC(\alpha)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\phi\text{ is a modal formula, and }\alpha(x)\models ST_x(\phi)\}
    \end{equation*}
    Our first claim is that if \(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\), then \(\alpha\) is
    equivalent to the translation of a modal formula.  Assume
    \(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\), then by the Compactness Theorem for first-order
    logic, for some finite subset \(X\subseteq MOC(\alpha)\), we have
    \(X\models\alpha(x)\). So \(\models\bigwedge X\to\alpha(x)\). Trivially
    \(\models\alpha(x)\to\bigwedge X\), thus
    \(\models\alpha(x)\leftrightarrow\bigwedge X\). And as every \(\beta\in X\)
    is the translation of a modal formula, so is \(\bigwedge X\)

    So it suffices to show that \(MOC(\alpha)\models\alpha(x)\). Assume
    \(\fM\models
    MOC(\alpha)[w]\); we need to show that \(\fM\models\alpha(x)[w]\). Let
    \begin{equation*}
    T(x)=\{ST_x(\phi)\mid\fM\models ST_x(\phi)[w]\}
    \end{equation*}
    We claim that \(T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}\) is consistent. Assume that
    \(T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}\) is inconsistent. Then by compactness, for some finite
    subset \(T_0(x)\subset T(x)\) we have \(\models\alpha(x)\to\neg\bigwedge
    T_x(x)\). Hence \(\neg\bigwedge T_0(x)\in MOC(\alpha)\). But this implies
    \(\fM\models\neg\bigwedge T_0(x)[w]\), a contradiction

    Let \(\fN,v\) be s.t. \(\fN\models T(x)\cup\{\alpha(x)\}[v]\). Observe that \(w\)
    and \(v\) are modally equivalent: \(\fM,w\Vdash\phi\) implies \(ST_x(\phi)\in
    T(x)\), which implies \(\fN,v\Vdash\phi\); and likewise, if
    \(\fM,w\not\Vdash\phi\) then \(\fM,w\Vdash\neg\phi\) and
    \(\fN,v\Vdash\neg\phi\).


    We can use the Detour Lemma and make a detour through a Hennessy-Milner
    class where modal equivalence and bisimilarity do coincide.

    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    \(\fN\models\alpha(x)[v]\) implies \(\fN^*\models\alpha(x)[v^*]\). As
    \(\alpha(x)\) is invariant for bisimulations, we get
    \(\fM^*\models\alpha(x)[w^*]\). By invariance under elementary embeddings,
    we have \(\fM\models\alpha(x)[w]\)

*** Definability
    Given a modal similarity type \tau, a pointed model is a pair \((\fM,w)\) where
    \(\fM\) is a \(\tau\)-model and \(w\) is a state of \(\fM\). A class of
    pointed models \(\sfK\) is said to be *closed under bisimulations* if
    \((\fM,w)\in\sfK\) and \(\fM,w\leftrightarroweq\fN,v\) implies
    \((\fN,v)\in\sfK\). \(\sfK\) is *closed under ultraproducts* if any
    ultraproducts \(\prod_U(\fM_i,w_i)\) of a family of pointed models
    \((\fM_i,w_i)\) in \(K\) belongs to \(\sfK\). If \(\sfK\) is a class of
    pointed \(\tau\)-models, \(\bbar{\sfK}\) denotes the complement of \(\sfK\)
    within the class of all pointed \(\tau\)-models. \(\sfK\) is
    *definable by a set of modal formulas* if there is a set of modal formulas \Gamma
    s.t. for any pointed model \((\fM,w)\) we have \((\fM,w)\) in \(\sfK\) iff

    single modal formula iff it is definable by a singleton set

    By Theorem ref:thm2.20 definable classes of pointed models must be closed

    2. \(\sfK\) is closed under bisimulations and ultraproducts, and
       \(\bbar{K}\) is closed under ultrapowers
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Assume \(\sfK\) and \(\bbar{\sfK}\) satisfy the stated closure conditions.
    Observe that \(\bbar{\sfK}\) is closed under bisimulations as \(\sfK\) is.
    Define
    \begin{equation*}
    T=\{\phi\mid\forall(\fM,w)\in\sfK:\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}
    \end{equation*}
    We will show that \(T\) defines the class of \(\sfK\).

    Assume \(\fM,w\Vdash T\). Define \(\Sigma=\{\phi\mid\fM,w\Vdash\phi\}\). It is
    obvious that \Sigma is finitely satisfiable in \(\sfK\); for suppose that the set
    \(\{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n\}\subseteq\Sigma\) is not satisfiable in
    \(\sfK\). Then the formula \(\neg(\sigma_1\wedge\dots\wedge\sigma_n)\) would
    be true on all pointed models in \(\sfK\), so it would belong to \(T\), yet
    be false in \(\fM,w\). But then the following claim shows that \Sigma is
    satisfiable in the ultraproduct of pointed models

    *Claim 1* . Let \Sigma be a set of modal formulas, and \(\sfK\) a class of pointed
     models in which \Sigma is finitely satisfiable. Then \Sigma is satisfiable in some
     ultraproduct of models in \(\sfK\)

     /Proof of Claim./ Define in index set \(I\) as the collection of all finite
     subsets of \Sigma
     \begin{equation*}
     I=\{\Sigma_0\subset\Sigma\mid \Sigma_0\text{ is finite}\}
     \end{equation*}
     By assumption, for each \(i\in I\) there is a pointed model \((\fN_i,v_i)\)
     in \(\sfK\) s.t. \(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash i\). We now construct an ultrafilter
     \(U\) over \(I\) s.t. the ultraprodcut \(\prod_U\fN_i\) has a state \(f_U\)
     with \(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma\)

     For each \(\sigma\in\Sigma\), let \(\widehat{\sigma}\) be the set of all \(i\in
     I\) s.t. \(\sigma\in i\). Then the set
     \(E=\{\widehat{\sigma}\mid\sigma\in\Sigma\}\) has the finite intersection
     property because
     \begin{equation*}
     \{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n\}\in\widehat{\sigma}_1\cap\dots\cap\widehat{\sigma}_n
     \end{equation*}
     So \(E\) can be extended to an ultrafilter \(U\) over \(I\). This defines
     \(\prod_U\fN_i\); for the definition of \(f_U\), let \(W_i\) denote the
     universe of the model \(\fN_i\) and consider the function \(f\in\prod_{i\in
     I}W_i\) s.t. \(f(i)=v_i\).
     It is left to prove that
     \begin{equation*}
     \prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma
     \end{equation*}
     Observe that for \(i\in\widehat{\sigma}\) we have \(\sigma\in i\) and so
     \(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\). Therefore for each \(\sigma\in\Sigma\)
     \begin{equation*}
     \{i\in I\mid\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\}\supseteq\widehat{\sigma} \quad\text{ and }\quad
     \widehat{\sigma}\in U
     \end{equation*}
     since \(\sigma\in i\) implies \(\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\). It follows that
     \(\{i\in I\mid\fN_i,v_i\Vdash\sigma\}\in U\), so by Theorem ref:thmA.19
     \(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\sigma\). Hence \(\prod_U\fN_i,f_U\Vdash\Sigma\)

     It follows from Claim 1 and the closure of \(\sfK\) under taking
     ultraproducts that \Sigma is satisfiable in some pointed model
     \((\fN,v)\in\sfK\). But \(\fN,v\Vdash\Sigma\) implies that \(v\) and the
     state \(w\)  from our _original pointed model \((\fM,w)\) are modally
     equivalent_. So by Theorem ref:thm2.74 there exists an ultrafilter \(U'\)
     s.t.
     \begin{equation*}
     \prod_{U'}(\fN,v),(f_v)_U\leftrightarroweq
     \prod_{U'}(\fM,w),(f_w)_U
     \end{equation*}
     By closure under ultraproducts, the pointed model
     \((\prod_{U'}(\fN,v),(f_v)_U)\) belongs to \(\sfK\). Hence by closure under
     bisimulations, \((\prod_{U'}(\fM,w),(f_w)_U)\) is in \(\sfK\). By closure

   Our first claim is that for any frame \(\fF=(W,R)\), the axiom T corresponds
   to *reflexivity* of the relation \(R\):
   \begin{equation*}
   \fF\Vdash \text{T}\quad\text{ iff }\quad
   \fF\Vdash\forall x\;Rxx
   \end{equation*}
   Suppose that \(R\) is *not* reflexive. There exists a state \(w\) which is not
   accessible from itself. Now the valuation \(V\) has to satisfy two conditions
   1. \(w\in V(p)\)
   2. \(\{x\in W\mid Rwx\}\cap V(p)=\emptyset\)


   Consider the *minimal* valuation \(V\) satisfying condition (1), that is, take
   \begin{equation*}
   V(p)=\{w\}
   \end{equation*}
   Now let \(v\) be an \(R\)-successor of \(w\). As \(Rww\) does not hold in
   \(\fF\), \(v\) must be distinct from \(w\), so \(v\not\Vdash p\). As \(v\)
   was arbitrary, \(w\not\Vdash p\)

   Likewise, one can prove that for any frame \(\fF=(W,R)\)
   \begin{alignat*}{3}
   &\fF\Vdash4&&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&R\text{ is transitive}\\
   &\fF\Vdash5\quad&&\quad\text{ iff }\quad&&
   R \text{ is euclidean}
   \end{alignat*}
   where a relation is *euclidean* if it satisfies \(\forall xyz((Rxy\wedge
   Rxz)\to Ryz)\).

   Assume \(\fF\) is a non-euclidean frame; then there must be states \(u,v,w\)
   s.t. \(Ruv,Ruw\) but not \(Rvw\):
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   [n/.style={circle,fill=black,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=2mm}]
   \node[n] (u) at (0,0) {};
   \node[n] (v) at (2,1) {};

   \draw[->](u) --  (w);
   \draw[->] (v) -- (v');
   \draw[->] (v)--node[strike out,draw,-]{} (w);
   \end{tikzpicture}
   We will try to falsify 5 in \(u\); for this purpose we have to find a
   valuation \(V\) s.t. \((\fF,V),u\Vdash\Diamond p\) and
   \((\fF,V),u\not\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\). In other words, we have to make \(p\)
   *true* at some \(R\)-successor \(x\) of \(u\), and *false* at all
   \(R\)-successors of some \(R\)-successor \(y\) of \(u\). The constaints on
   \(V\) are
   1. \(w\in V(p)\)
   2. \(\{z\mid Rvz\}\cap V(p)=\emptyset\)


   Let's take a *maximal* \(V\) satisfying condition (2), that is, define
   \begin{equation*}
   V(p)=\{z\in W\mid\text{ it is not the case that }Rvz\}
   \end{equation*}
   Now \(v\not\Vdash\Diamond p\), so \(u\not\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\). On the other

   Consider the Löb formula \(\Box(\Box p\to p)\to \Box p\), which we will call
   it \(L\) for brevity. We show that \(L\) defines the class of frames
   \((W,R)\) s.t. \(R\) is transitive and \(R\)'s converse is well-founded

   We will then show that this is a class of frames that first-order frame
   languages *cannot* define; that is, we will show that this class is not
   elementary

   Assume that \(\fF=(W,R)\) is a frame with a transitive and conversely
   well-founded relation, and then suppose that \(L\) is not valid in \(\fF\).
   This means that there is a valuation \(V\) and a state \(w\) s.t.
   \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\to\Box p\). In other words,
   \(w\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\) but \(w\not\Vdash\Box p\). Then \(w\) must have
   a successor \(w_1\) s.t. \(w_1\not\Vdash p\), and as \(w_1\Vdash\Box p\to
   p\), we have \(w_1\not\Vdash\Box p\). This in turn implies that \(w_1\) have
   a successor \(w_2\) where \(p\) is false; note that by the transitivity of
   \(R\), \(w_2\) is also a successor of \(w\). Again, \(w_2\) must have a
   \(p\)-falsifying successor \(w_3\) . Hence we find an infinite path
   \(wRw_1Rw_2R\dots\) contradicting the converse well-foundedness of \(R\)

   For the other direction, assume that either \(R\) is not transitive or its
   converse is not well-founded; in both cases we have to find a valuation \(V\)
   and a state \(w\) s.t. \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash L\). Assume that \(R\) is
   transitive, but not conversely well-founded. In other words, suppose we have
   a transitive frame containing an infinite sequence \(w_0Rw_1Rw_2R\dots\).
   Define
   \begin{equation*}
   V(p)=W\setminus\{x\in W\mid \text{ there is an infinite path starting from }x\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(\Box p\to p\) is true *everywhere* in the model, whence certainly,
   \((\fF,V),w_0\Vdash\Box(\Box p\to p)\). The claim then follows from the fact
   that \((\fF,V),w_0\not\Vdash \Box p\)

   Assume that \(R\) is not transitive and its converse is well-founded. Since
   \(R\) is not transitive, there is \(Rw_1w_2\) and \(Rw_2w_3\) but \(\neg
   Rw_1w_3\). Let \(V(p)=\{w_2,w_3\}\). Then \((\fF,V),w_1\Vdash\Diamond p\) and
   \((\fF,V),w_1\Vdash\neg\Diamond(p\wedge\neg\Diamond p)\)

   Finally, to show that the class of frames defined by \(L\) is not elementary,
   an easy compactness argument suffices. Suppose for the sake of a
   contradiction that there is a first-order formula equivalent to \(L\); call
   this formula \lambda. As \lambda is equivalent to \(L\), and model making \lambda true must be
   transitive. Let \(\sigma_n(x_0,\dots,x_n)\) be the first-order formula
   stating that there is an \(R\)-path of length \(n\) through
   \(x_0,\dots,x_n\):
   \begin{equation*}
   \sigma_n(x_0,\dots,x_n)=\bigwedge_{0\le i<n}Rx_ix_{i+1}
   \end{equation*}
   Every *finite* subset of
   \begin{equation*}
   \Sigma=\{\lambda\}\{\forall xyz((Rxy\wedge Ryz)\to Rxz)\}\cup\{\sigma_n\mid n\in\omega\}
   \end{equation*}
   is satisfiable in a finite linear order, and hence in the class of
   transitive, conversely well-founded frames. Thus \Sigma must have a model. But it
   is clear that \Sigma is *not* satisfiable in any conversely well-founded frame.

   transitive closure of the transitive relation \(R_\pi\) of \(\pi\).

   Consider the following set of formulas

   Our first observation is that \(\fF\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\to\Diamond\Box p\).
   
   If \(\fF,v_n\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\), then both two
   \(\fF,v_{(n,i)}\Vdash\Diamond p\), which means
   \(\{v_{(n,0)},v_{(n,1)}\}\subseteq V(p)\). Hence \(\fF,v_{(n,i)}\Vdash\Box
   p\) and \(\fF,v_n\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\to\Diamond\Box p\).

   If \(\fF,z_f\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\), then for each \(n\in\N\), there is a
   \(i=0\text{ or }1\) s.t. \(\fF,v_{(n,i)}\Vdash\Diamond p\). Then
   \(\fF,v_{(n,i)}\Vdash p\)

   If \(\fF,w\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\), then either \(v_{(n,0)}\in V(p)\) or
   \(v_{(n,1)}\in V(p)\). Choose \(f:\N\to\{0,1\}\) s.t.
   \(\fF,v_{(n,f(n))}\Vdash p\) for each \(n\in N\). Then clearly
   \(\fF,z_f\Vdash\Box p\), and so \(\fF,w\Vdash\Diamond\Box p\)

   In order to show that \(\Box\Diamond p\to\Diamond\Box p\) does not define a
   first-order frame condition, let us view the frame \(\fF\) as a first-order
   model with domain \(W\). By the downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, there must
   be a countable elementary submodel \(\fF'\) of \(\fF\) whose domain \(W'\)
   contains \(w\) and each \(v_n,v_{(n,0)},v_{(n,1)}\). As \(W\) is uncountable
   and \(W'\) countable, there must be a mapping \(f:\N\to\{0,1\}\) s.t.
   \(z_f\not\in W'\). Now if the McKinsey formula was equivalent to a
   first-order formula it would be valid on \(\fF'\). But we will show that the
   McKinsey formula is *not* valid on \(\fF'\), hence it cannot be equivalent to a
   first-order formula

   Let \(V'\) be a valuation on \(\fF'\) s.t. \(V'(p)=\{v_{(n,f(n))}\mid
   n\in\N\}\), here  \(f\) is a mapping s.t. \(z_f\not\in W'\).

   First, \((\fF',V'),w\not\Vdash\Diamond\Box p\).

   Then we need to show that \((\fF',V'),w\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\). Consider
   arbitrary element \(z_g\) of \(W'\). Call two states \(z_h\) and \(z_k\) of
   \(\fF\) *complementary* if for all \(n\), \(h(n)=1-k(n)\). Now suppose \(z_g\)
   is complement to \(z_f\); since complementary states are unique, the fact
   that \(\fF'\) is an elementary submodel of \(\fF\) would imply that \(z_f\)
   exists in \(\fF'\) (\(\fF'\models\forall f\exists g(f,g\text{ are
   complement})\)). Hence we may conclude tha \(z_g\) is *not* complementary to
   \(z_f\). Hence there exists some \(n\in\N\) s.t. \(g(n)=f(n)\). Therefore
   \((\fF',V'),z_g\Vdash\Diamond p\). Then \((\fF',V'),w\Vdash\Box\Diamond p\)

      \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\) but 
      \((\fF,V),w\Vdash \neg p\). This is done by \(V(p)=W-\{w\}\)
   2. If \(R\) is reflexive but not transitive, then there is \(wRuRv\) but not
      \(wRv\).
      Let \(V\) be an evaluation on \(\fF\) s.t. \(V(p)=W-\{w,v\}\). Then
      \((\fF,V),u\Vdash p\wedge\Diamond\neg p\) and hence
      \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Diamond(p\wedge\Diamond\neg p)\). This is equivalent to
      \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\), from which it follows that
      \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p\). Thus for all \(x\in w\uparrow\),
      \((\fF,V),x\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p\) and hence
      \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\) but \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash p\)
   3. If \(R\) is reflexive and transitive, but there is some infinite path
      \(x_0Rx_1Rx_2R\dots\) s.t. for all \(i\), \(x_i\neq x_{i+1}\), then let
      \(V\) be an evaluation on \(\fF\) s.t. \(V(p)=W-\{x_{2k}\mid k\in\N\}\).
      For all \(x_{2k}\) with some \(k\in\N\), \((\fF,V),x_{2k+2}\Vdash\neg p\)
      and \((\fF,V),x_{2k+1}\Vdash p\). It follows that \((\fF,V),x_{2k+1}\Vdash
      p\wedge\Diamond\neg p\) and
      \((\fF,V),x_{2k}\Vdash\Diamond(p\wedge\Diamond\neg p)\). Hence
      \((\fF,V),x_{2k}\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p\). For all \(u\in
      W-\{x_{2k}\mid k\in\N\}\), \((\fF,V),u\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p\)


   Now to prove \(\fF\Vdash\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\to p\). Suppose there is
   an evaluation \(V\) and a point \(w\) s.t.
   \((\fF,V),w\not\Vdash\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\to p\). It follows
   \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Box(\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p)\) and \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\neg
   p\).
   Then for all \(u\in w\uparrow\), \((\fF,V),u\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to p\).
   Since \(R\) is reflexive and transitive, \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box p)\to
   p\). It follows that
   \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\Diamond(p\wedge\neg\Box p)\). Hence there is a point \(v\in
   w\uparrow\) s.t. \((\fF,V),v\Vdash p\wedge\neg\Box p\). Since
   \((\fF,V),w\Vdash\neg p\), \(v\neq w\). And there is some point \(v'\in
   v\uparrow\), \((\fF,V),v'\Vdash\neg p\), this also shows that \(v'\neq v\).
   By the transitivity, \(v'\in w\uparrow\), \((\fF,V),v'\Vdash\Box(p\to\Box
   p)\to p\). Similarly we can find a distinct point \(v''\in v'\uparrow\) s.t.
   \((\fF,V),v''\Vdash p\wedge p\wedge\neg\Box p\). By repeating this line of
   reasoning, we can find an infinite pathsin which each point is different from
   its successor. This contradicts 3.

** Finite Frames
*** Finite transitive frames
    Let \(\fF=(W,R)\) be a point-generated finite transitive frame for the basic
    modal similarity type, and let \(w\) be a root of \(\fF\). The Jankov-Fine
    formula \(\phi_{\fF,w}\) is a description of \(\fF\) that has the following
    property: it is satisfiable on a frame iff \(\fF\) is a bounded morphic
    image of a generated subframe of \(\fG\)

    We build Jankov-Fine formulas as follows. Enumerate the states of \(\fF\) as
    \(w_0,\dots,w_n\), where \(w=w_0\). Associate each state \(w_i\) with a
    distinct proposition letter \(p_i\). Let \(\phi_{\fF,w}\) be the conjunction
    of the following formulas:
    1. \(p_0\)
    2. \(\Box(p_0\vee\dots\vee p_n)\)
    3. \((p_i\to\neg p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\neg p_j)\) for each \(i\neq j\le n\)
    4. \((p_i\to\Diamond p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\Diamond p_j)\) for each \(i,j\)
       with \(Rw_iw_j\)
    5. \((p_i\to\neg\Diamond p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\neg\Diamond p_j)\) for each
       \(i,j\) with \(\neg Rw_iw_j\)


    Note that as \(R\) is transitive, each node in \(\fF\) is accessible in one
    step from \(w\). It followss that when formulas of the form
    \(\psi\wedge\Box\psi\) are satisfied at \(w\) , \psi is true throughout \(\fF\).

    \(\fF\) and \(w\). Then for any transitive frame \(\fG\) we have the
    following equivalence: there is a valuation \(V\) and a node \(v\) s.t.
    \((\fG,V),v\Vdash\phi_{\fF,w}\) iff there exists a bounded morphism from
    \(\fG_v\) onto \(\fF\)

    Left to right. Suppose there is a valuation \(V\) and a node \(v\) s.t.
    \((\fG,V),v\Vdash\phi_{\fF,w}\).  1 shows that \(v\in V(p_0)\). 2 and 3
    shows that each of states satisfies exactly one of proposition letter
    \(p_i\). Hence we build a function \(f:\fG_v\to\fF\) as \(f(v_i)=w_j\) if
    \(v_i\in V(p_j)\) for each \(v_i\in\fG\). 2 and 3 show that this function is
    well-defined.

    Suppose \(R_{\fG}v_iv_j\) and \(\neg R_{\fF}w_iw_j\), then \((\fG,V),g\Vdash
    p_i\to\neg\Diamond p_j\) for all \(g\in\fG\). However, \((\fG,V),v_i\Vdash
    p_i\) and \((\fG,V),v_j\Vdash p_j\)

    If \(R_{\fF}f(v_i)w_j\), then \((\fG,V),v_i\Vdash p_{f(v_i)}\to\Diamond
    p_j\). Hence there is a successor \(v_j\) of \(v_i\) s.t. \(f(v_j)=w_j\).
    Therefore we find \(R_{\fG}v_iv_j\) and \(f\) is a bounded morphism

    Right to left. Suppose there is a bounded morphism \(f\) from \(\fG_v\) onto
    \(\fF\). Then clearly \(f(v)=w_0\). Let \(V(p_{f(v_i)})=\{v_j\mid f(v_j)=f(v_i)\}\) for all
    \(v_i\in\fG\) . Then \((\fG,V),v\Vdash p_0\wedge\Box(p_0\vee\dots\vee p_n)
    \wedge(p_i\to\neg p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\neg p_j)\).If \(R_{\fF}w_iw_j\) and
    there is a \(v_i\in\fG\) s.t. \(f(v_i)=w_i\), then there is a \(f(v_j)=w_j\)
    s.t. \(R_{\fG}v_iv_j\). Hence \((\fF,V),v\Vdash (p_i\to\Diamond
    p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\Diamond p_j)\) for each \(i,j\) with \(Rw_iw_j\). 5 is

    all }\fF\in\sfK\}\). We will show that \(\Lambda_{\sfK}\) defines \(\sfK\).
    We need to show that if \(\fF\Vdash\Lambda_{\sfK}\), where \(\fF\) is finite
    and transitive, then \(\fF\in\sfK\).

    First suppose \(\fF\) is point-generated with root \(w\). Consider the
    Jankov-Fine formula \(\phi_{\fF,w}\) for \(\fF\) and \(w\). Clearly
    \(\phi_{\fF,w}\) is satisfiable in \(\fF\) at \(w\), so
    \(\neg\phi_{\fF,w}\not\in\Lambda_{\sfK}\). Hence there is some
    \(\fG\in\sfK\) s.t. \(\fG\not\Vdash\neg\phi_{\fF,w}\); hence there is some
    valuation \(V\) and state \(v\) s.t. \((\fG,V),v\Vdash\phi_{\fF,w}\). Thus
    by the previous lemma, \(\fF\) is a bounded morphic image of the
    point-generated subframe \(\fG_v\) of \(\fG\). By the closure condition on
    \(\sfK\), it follows that \(\fF\in\sfK\).

    Suppose that \(\fF\) is not point-generated. But then as
    \(\fF\Vdash\Lambda_{\sfK}\), so does each point-generated subframe of
    \(\fF\), hence all these subframes belongs to \(\sfK\). \(\fF\) is a bounded
    morphic image of the disjoint union of its rooted generated subfrmaes,

    Left to right. Suppose there is a valuation \(V\) and a node \(v\) s.t.
    \((\fG,V),v\Vdash\phi_{\fF,w}\).  1 shows that \(v\in V(p_0)\). 2 and 3
    shows that each of states satisfies exactly one of proposition letter

    \(v_i\in V(p_j)\) for each \(v_i\in\fG\). 2 and 3 show that this function is
    well-defined.

    Suppose \(R_{\fG}v_iv_j\) and \(\neg R_{\fF}w_iw_j\), then \((\fG,V),g\Vdash

    If \(R_{\fF}f(v_i)w_j\), then \((\fG,V),v_i\Vdash p_{f(v_i)}\to\Diamond
    p_j\). Hence there is a successor \(v_j\) of \(v_i\) s.t. \(f(v_j)=w_j\).
    Therefore we find \(R_{\fG}v_iv_j\) and \(f\) is a bounded morphism

    Right to left. Suppose there is a bounded morphism \(f\) from \(\fG_v\) onto
    \(\fF\). Then clearly \(f(v)=w_0\). Let \(V(p_{f(v_i)})=\{v_j\mid f(v_j)=f(v_i)\}\) for all

    \wedge(p_i\to\neg p_j)\wedge\Box(p_i\to\neg p_j)\).If \(R_{\fF}w_iw_j\) and
    there is a \(v_i\in\fG\) s.t. \(f(v_i)=w_i\), then there is a \(f(v_j)=w_j\)

   Suppose \(\Diamond\phi\in w\). Let \(v^-=\{\phi\}\cup\{\psi\mid\Box\psi\in

   \(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\) s.t.
   \(\vdash_\Lambda(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)\to\neg\phi\), then we have
   \(\vdash_\Lambda\Box(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)\to\Box\neg\phi\).  Also
   as
   \((\Box\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\Box\psi_n)\to\Box(\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\psi_n)\),
   then we
   \(\vdash_\Lambda(\Box\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\Box\psi_n)\to\Box\neg\phi\). Now
   \(\Box\psi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\Box\psi_n\in w\) thus it follows that
   \(\Box\neg\phi\in w\). Using dual, it follows that \(\neg\Diamond\phi\in w\),

   Let \(v\) be any MCS extending \(v^-\); such extensions exist by Lindenbaum's

   based on a \(\KL\)-frame can satisfy all formulas in \Gamma at a single point.

   To show that \Gamma is consistent, it suffices to show that every finite subset \Psi
   of \Gamma is consistent. Given any such \Psi, for some natural number \(n\) there is
   a finite set \Phi of the form \(\{\Diamond q_1\}\cup\{\Box(q_i\to\Diamond

   that \Phi, and hence \Psi, is consistent.

   Let \(\widehat{\Phi}\) be the conjunction of all the formulas in \Phi. To show that
   \(\widehat{\Phi}\) is \(\KL\)-consistent, it suffices to show that it can be
   satisfied in a model based on a frame for \(\KL\), for this shows that
   \(\neg\widehat{\Phi}\) is not valid on all frames for \(\KL\). Let \(\fF\) be
   the frame consisting of \(\{0,\dots,n\}\) in their usual order; as this is a
   transitive, converse well-founded frame by Example ref:example3.9 it is a
   frame for \(\KL\). Let \(\fM\) be any model based on \(\fF\) s.t. for all
   \(1\le i\le n\), \(V(q_i)=\{i\}\). Then \(\fM,0\Vdash\widehat{\Phi}\) and
   \(\widehat{\Phi}\) is \(\KL\)-consistent

   Next, suppose that \(\KL\) is sound and strongly complete w.r.t. some class
   of frames \(\sfF\); note that as \(\KL\) is not the inconsistent logic,
   \(\sfF\) must be non-empty. Thus any \(\KL\)-consistent set of formulas can
   be satisfied at some point in a model based on a frame in \(\sfF\). In
   particular, there is \(\fM,w\Vdash\Gamma\). But this is impossible: because

   /S2-defects/

   Assume that there are nodes \(s\) and \(t\) in \(N\) for which there is no
   intermediate point. By coherence of \(\caln\), \(\nu(s)R^c\nu(t)\), and by
   canonicity of the density axiom that there is some MCS \Gamma s.t.
   \(\nu(s)R^c\Gamma R^c\nu(t)\). Hence take some /new/ node \(u\) and define
   \(\caln'=(N',<',\nu')\) by

   &N'&&:=&&N\cup\{u\}\\
   &<'&&:=&&<\cup\{(x,u)\mid x\le s\}\cup\{(u,x)\mid t\le x\}\\
   &\nu'&&:=&&\nu\cup\{(u,\Gamma)\}
   \end{alignat*}
   Now we need to prove \(\caln'\) is coherent.

   /S3-defects/

   We only treat the P-defects. Assume that there is a node \(s\) in \(N\) and a
   formula \(P\psi\in\nu(s)\)  for which is no \(t\) in \(N\) s.t. \(t<s\) and \(\psi\in\nu(t)\)

   Let \(m\) be the unique point in \(N\) s.t.
   1. \((m,P\psi)\) is an S3-defect in \(\caln\)
   2. for all \(w<m\), \((w,P\psi)\) is /not/ a defect.


   Such an \(m\) must exist (it is either \(s\) itself or one of the finitely
   many points preceding \(s\)) and, we can repair \((m,P\psi)\) without
   problems by simply inserting the new point \(s'\) immediately before \(m\)

   Choose some new point \(s'\) and let \Psi be an MCS containing \psi s.t.
   \(\Psi R^c \nu(m)\); such a \Psi exists by the Existence Lemma for normal logics.
   Define \(\caln'=(N',<',\nu')\) as follows
   \begin{alignat*}{3}
   &N'&&:=&&N\cup\{s'\}\\
   &<'&&:=&&<\cup\{(x,s')\mid x<m\}\cup\{(s',x)\mid m\le x\}\\
   &\nu'&&:=&&f\cup\{(s',\Psi)\}
   \end{alignat*}
   It only remains to ensure that \(\caln'\) satisfies the second coherency
   condition

   Suppose \(x<s'\). By construction \(\nu(s')=\Psi R^c\nu(m)\), and by coherency
   of \(\caln\), \(\nu(x)R^c\nu(m)\). But \(R^c\) is the canonical relation for
   \(\KtQ\) - a relation with no branching to the left - hence either \(\Psi
   R^c\nu(x),\Psi=\nu(x)\) or \(\nu(x)R^c\Psi\). We claim that the first two
   options are impossible. For if \(\Psi R^c\nu(x)\) then \(\psi\in\Psi\) would

   \item [(IRR)] if \(\vdash(\neg Pp\wedge p\wedge\neg Fp)\to\phi\) then \(\vdash\phi\), provided

   Note that on the class of strict total orders the formula

   Finally \(W\) is defined as the range of this infinite labeling function

   is a label function mapping each node of \(N\) to a /finite/ set of formulas

   We first want to formulate coherence conditions on networks and dfine the
   notion of a defect of network w.r.t. its ideal, \(W\). Since we are working
   in the basic temporal similarity type - that is, we have diamonds both for

   describing the network, from each of its nodes. Let \(\caln=(N,E,d,\Lambda)\) be

   P&\text{if }d(t,s)=R^\smallsmile

   Moreover, let \(E(s)\) denote the set of nodes adjacent to \(s\). Finally, we
   let \(\lambda(s)\) denote the conjunction \(\bigwedge\Lambda(s)\). Define

   \end{align*}
   In other words, \(\Delta(\caln,s)\) starts with a local description \(\lambda(s)\) of
   \(s\) and then proceeds to its neighbors. For each neighbor \(v\),
   \(\Delta(\caln,s)\) writes a function operator if \(d(s,v)=R\) and then starts to
   describe the network after \(v\) by calling \theta. \(\theta(\caln,v,s)\) first gives a
   local description \(\lambda(v)\) of \(v\), an then recursively proceeds to the
   neighbors of \(v\) - except for \(s\). The omission of \(s\), together with
   the finiteness and acyclicity of the graph, ensures that we end up with a

   For any network \(\caln\) and any two nodes \(s,t\) in \(\caln\),
   \(\Delta(\caln,s)\) is consistent iff \(\Delta(\caln, t)\) is consistent
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   By the connectedness of \(\caln\) it is sufficient to prove the Lemma for
   adjacent \(s\) and \(t\).

   So suppose that \(s\) and \(t\) are adjacent; without loss of generality
   assume that \(d(s,t)=R\). Since \(\caln\) is fixed it won't lead to confusion
   if we abbreviate \(\Delta(\caln,x)\) by \(\Delta(x)\) and \(\theta(\caln,x,y)\) by
   \(\theta(x,y)\). Then by definition, \(\Delta(s)\) is given by
   \begin{align*}
   \Delta(s)&=\lambda(s)\wedge\bigwedge_{u\in E(s)}\la su\ra\theta(u,s)\\
   &=\lambda(s)\wedge F\theta(t,s)\wedge\bigwedge_{t\neq u\in E(s)}\la su\ra\theta(u,s)\\
   &=F\theta(t,s)\wedge\theta(s,t)
   \end{align*}
   Likewise we can show that
   \begin{equation*}
   \Delta(t)=\theta(t,s)\wedge P\theta(s,t)
   \end{equation*}
   But it is a general property of any logic extending \(\bK_t\) that for any
   two formulas \alpha and \beta, \(F\alpha\wedge\beta\) is consistent iff \(\alpha\wedge
   P\beta\) is consistent
   #+END_proof

   We call a network \(\caln\) *coherent* if \(\Delta(\caln,s)\) is consistent for each
   of its nodes.

   A *defect* of a network is either
   1. a pair \((s,\phi)\) s.t. neither \phi nor \(\neg\phi\) belongs to \(\Lambda(s)\)
   2. a pair \((s,F\phi)\) s.t.  \(F\phi\in\Lambda(s)\) while there is no
      witness for this in the sense that \(\phi\in\Lambda(t)\) for some node
      \(t\) with \(Est\) and \(d(s,t)=R\)
   3. a similar pair \((s,P\phi)\)
   4. a node \(s\) without a name; that is, \(name(\phi)\in\Lambda(s)\) for no formula


   A network \(\caln'\) *extends* a network \(\caln\) (\(\caln'\rhd\caln\)) if
   \(N\subseteq N'\) while \(E=E'\cap N\times N,d=d'\vert_N\) and

   If \(\Delta(\caln,s)\) is consistent, then there is a propositional variable

   show that the formula \(\Delta(\caln,s)\wedge name(p)\) is consistent
   #+END_proof
   
   Now we return to the proof of Proposition ref:prop4.71
   #+BEGIN_proof
   By a standard step-by-step construction we can define a sequence
   \((\caln_i)_{i\in\N}\) of networks s.t.
   1. \(\caln_0\) is a one-node network with label set \(\{\xi\}\)
   2. \(\caln_j\) extends \(\caln_i\) whenever \(i<j\)
   3. for every defect of any network \(\caln_i\) there is a network \(\caln_j\)
      with \(j>i\) lacking this defect


   Let \(N\) be the set \(\bigcup_{i\in\N}N_i\); and for \(s\in N\), define
   \(\Lambda(s)=\bigcup_{i\in\N}\Lambda_i(s)\). We claim that for every \(s\in N\),
   \(\Lambda(s)\) is a witnessing MCS. Assume \(\Lambda(s)\) is not consistent; then there
   are formulas \(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\) in \(\Lambda(s)\) s.t.
   \(\phi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\phi_n\) is inconsistent. By construction, there
   must be a \(k\in\N\) s.t. each \(\phi_i\) belongs to \(\Lambda_k(s)\). But
   this contradicts the consistency of \(\Delta(\caln_k,s)\) and hence the coherency
   of \(\caln_k\)

   Finally define \(W\) as the range of \Lambda. The preceding paragraphs show that
   \(W\) is a collection of witnessing MCSs. By out definition of \(\caln_0\),
   it follows that \xi belongs to some MCS in \(W\)

   Now let \(F\phi\) be some formula in \(\Gamma\in W\). By definition, there is
   some \(s\in N\) s.t. \(\Gamma=\Lambda(s)\), and thus, some \(i\in\N\) s.t.
   \(F\phi\in\Lambda_i(s)\). By our construction there is some \(j\ge i\) and
   some \(t\in N_j\) s.t. \(E_jst\) and \(\phi\in\Lambda_j(t)\). It follows that
   \(\phi\in\Lambda(t)\), so it remains to prove that \(\Lambda(s)R^c\Lambda(t)\).
   Suppose otherwise, then there is a formula \(\psi\in\Lambda(t)\) s.t.
   \(F\psi\not\in\Lambda(s)\). Since \(\Lambda(s)\) is an MCS, this implies \(\neg
   F\psi\in\Lambda(s)\). Now let \(k\in\N\) be large enough that
   \(\psi\in\Lambda_k(t)\) and \(\neg F\psi\in\Lambda_k(s)\). From this it is
   immediate that \(\Delta(\caln_k,s)\) is inconsistent

   Let \(W\) be a diamond saturated collection of witnessing maximal consistent

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(W\) and \(<\) be as in the frame. \((W,<)\) is a subframe of the

   as transitivity and non-branching. Irreflexivity follows from the fact that
   \(\Gamma R^c\Gamma\) for no witnessing \Gamma.

   Unboundedness is not a universal condition. As \(F\top\) and \(P\top\) are
   theorems of the logic and hence belong to every maximal consistent set

   For density. Assume that \Gamma and \Delta are two MCSs s.t. \(\Gamma<\Delta\). We have to
   find an MCS \Theta in \(W\) that lies between \Gamma and \Delta. Let \delta be the formula s.t.
   \(name(\delta)\in\Delta\). It follows from \(\Gamma<\Delta\) that
   \(Fname(\delta)\in\Gamma\), so using the density axiom, we find that
   \(FFname(\delta)\in\Gamma\). From this we may infer the existence of an MCS
   \(\Theta\in W\) with \(\Gamma<\Theta\) and \(Fname(\delta)\in\Theta\).

   But is \(\Theta<\Delta\). Note that since < is non-branching to the right, we
   already know that \(\Theta<\Delta\) or \(\Theta=\Delta\) or \(\Delta<\Theta\). But its
   clear that \(F\delta\in\Theta\) and \(\neg F\delta\in\Delta\). Neither is it
   possible that \(\Delta<\Theta\)for suppose otherwise. It would follows that

   As \(\delta\wedge\la\pi\ra\neg\delta\) is inconsistent,
   \(\vdash\delta\to[\pi]\delta\), hence by generalization

   If \Lambda is a normal modal logic, and \(\sfM\) is any class of models s.t.
   \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfM}\), then the \(\Lambda\)-consistency problem is the
   \(\sfM\)-satisfiability problem, and the \(\Lambda\)-provability problem is
   the \(\sfM\)-validity problem.

   Let \tau be a modal similarity type. A frame of type \tau has *finite character* if
   it contains finitely many states, and finitely many non-empty relations. If
   \Lambda is a normal logic in a language for \tau, and \(\sfF\) is a class of
   \(\tau\)-frames of finite character, and \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfF}\), then
   \Lambda is said to have the *finite frame property* (f.f.p.) w.r.t. \(\sfF\). If
   \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfF}\) for some class of \(\tau\)-frames \(\sfF\) of
   finite character, then \Lambda has the finite frame property.

   A class of \(\tau\)-models \(\sfM\) is *finitely based* if every model in
   \(\sfM\) is based on a \(\tau\)-frame of finite character. If \Lambda is a normal
   modal logic in a language for \tau, and \(\sfM\) is a class of finitely based
   \(\tau\)-models, and \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfM}\), then \Lambda has the *finite model
   property* (f.m.p.) w.r.t. \(\sfM\). If \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfM}\) for some
   class of finitely based \(\tau\)-models \(\sfM\) then \Lambda has the finite model property

    Finally, a class of frames of finite character (or indeed, a class of finite
    frames) may well be a proper class. Nonetheless, up to isomorphism, there
    are only denumerably many frames in any such class; hence, if \Lambda has the
    finite frame property, it has the finite frame property with respect to a
    denumerably infinite set of frames

    \(\Lambda=\Lambda_{\sfF}\) is equivalent to \(\sfF\Vdash\Lambda\) and for

    s.t. \phi is falsifiable on \(\fF\)

    Let \(E\) be any subset of \(\calp(I)\) and let \(D\) be the filter
    generated by \(E\). Then
    1. \(D\) is a filter over \(I\)
    2. \(D\) is the set of all \(X\in\calp(I)\) s.t. either \(X\equiv I\) or for
       some \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\in E\)
       \begin{equation*}
       Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\subset X
       \end{equation*}
    3. \(D\) is a proper filter iff \(E\) has the finite intersection property
    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    2. [@2] Let \(D'\) be the set of all \(X\in\calp(I)\) s.t. \(X=I\) or fro
       some \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\in E\), \(Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\subset X\). We show
       that \(D=D'\). We have put \(I\in D'\). Let \(X,X'\in D'\) and let
       \(Y_i,Y_j'\in E\) s.t.
       \begin{equation*}
       Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\subset X,\quad
       Y_1'\cap\dots\cap Y_m'\subset X'
       \end{equation*}
       If \(X\subset Z\subset I\), then
       \begin{equation*}
       Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\subset Z
       \end{equation*}
       so \(Z\in D'\). Moreover
       \begin{equation*}
       Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\cap Y_1'\cap\dots\cap Y_m'\subset X\cap X'
       \end{equation*}
       so \(X\cap X'\in D'\). Therefore \(D'\) is a filter over \(I\). Obviously
       \(E\subset D'\). It follows that \(D\subset D'\)

       Now consider any filter \(F\) over \(I\) which includes \(E\). Then
       \(I\in F\). For any \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\in E\), we have \(Y_1\cap\dots\cap
       Y_n\in F\), and hence any \(X\in\calp(I)\), which includes
       \(Y_1\cap\dots\cap Y_n\) belongs to \(F\). Thus \(D'\subset F\) and hence
       \(D'\subset D\), whence \(D=D'\)
