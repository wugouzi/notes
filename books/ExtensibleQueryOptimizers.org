* Introduction
** Key Challenges in Query Optimization
        *Search space*

        *Cost estimation*

        *Search algorithm*

*  Key Transformation
** Access Path Transformation
        *Access path selection* focuses on choosing the access method(s) that minimize the cost of retrieving
        the requested data from the base relations

        We illustrate some alternatives for access path selection using an example of a single-table query.
        Consider a table \(S(id, a, b, c)\) with four columns, where \(id\) is the primary key of table \(S\), and suppose
        the following B+-tree indexes exist on the table:
        * Index \(I_{id}\) is a primary key clustered index where the key column of the index is the \(id\) column.
        * \(I_a\) and \(I_b\) are single-column non-clustered indexes where the key columns are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
        * \(I_a(c, b)\) is a non-clustered index where the key column is \(a\) and the include columns are \(c\) and \(b\).
        * \(I_b(c, a)\) is a non-clustered index where the key column is \(b\) and the include columns are
          \(c\) and \(a\).

        An *include* column of an index cannot be used to seek values, however, the value of each include column
        is available in the index, and hence can be used for projecting and filtering once the rows have been
        retrieved from the index.

        Now consider
        #+begin_src sql
SELECT S.a, S.b
FROM S
WHERE S.a > 10 AND S.b = 20
        #+end_src

        In some cases, we can retrieve rows from a single table by combining multiple access methods on the
        table. Consider the plan shown in Figure [[ref:f4.1]]e. Here, we can use the index \(I_a\) to identify the
        rows satisfying the predicate \(S.a > 10\). Then for each such row, we use a Key Lookup on the
        clustered index \(I_id\) to lookup the value of \(S.b\) for that row and then apply the Filter
        operator with the predicate \(S.b = 20\).

** Inner Join Transformations
        Inner join is the most commonly used join type, which outputs a tuple corresponding to a pair of rows
        from the joined relations if and only if that pair satisfies the join condition.
*** Join commutativity and associativity
        We start with the logical transformation rules of join ordering for equi-joins, including:
        * Commutativity: \(A\bowtie B\Rightarrow B\bowtie A\)
        * Right associativity: \((A\bowtie B)\bowtie C\Rightarrow A\bowtie(B\bowtie C)\)
        * Left associativity: \(A\bowtie(B\bowtie C)\Rightarrow(A\bowtie B)\bowtie C\)

        To illustrate why join commutativity is useful, consider the transformed expression \(B\bowtie A\). If
        there is an index on column \(A.z\), then the plan where a Nested Loops Join is used with an Index
        Seek on \(A.z\) becomes possible, but only after the join commutativity rule is invoked on the
        original expression.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .89\textwidth :float nil
        #+NAME: f4.5
        #+CAPTION:
        [[../images/Misc/8.png]]

        Suppose \(C\) is a large table, e.g., a fact table in a data warehouse, and \(A\) and \(B\) are
        smaller tables, e.g., dimension tables. In this case, if both join operators are Hash Joins with table
        \(A\) and \(B\) on the build side respectively, then using a single scan of table \(C\), we can probe
        the hash table for \(B\) and the resulting output rows can be used to probe the hash table for \(A\).
        Such a plan can be efficient when there is sufficient memory to hold hash tables of \(A\) and \(B\).
*** Push-down (pull-up) of filters below join
*** Physical transformation rules of inner join
        Nested Loops Join is the only join method that applies to arbitrary inner joins, e.g., if the join
        predicate is a user-defined function. In contrast, Hash Join can be used only for equi-joins. Since
        Merge Join requires its inputs to be sorted on the join column(s), it can be effective when an
        explicit sort operation is not required on the results of one or both of its inputs.
** Outer Join Transformations
        Notation: left outer join (\(\leftarrow\)), right outer join (\(\to\)), full outer join (\(\leftrightarrow\))
*** Commutativity and associativity
        * \(A\leftarrow B\Leftrightarrow B\to A\), \(A\leftrightarrow B\Leftrightarrow B\leftrightarrow A\)
        * \((A\leftarrow B)\leftrightarrow C\Leftrightarrow A\leftarrow(B\leftarrow C)\),
          \((A\leftrightarrow B)\leftrightarrow C\Leftrightarrow A\leftrightarrow(B\leftrightarrow C)\)

        For more rule, refer [[cite:&10.1145/244810.244812]]
*** Redundancy rule
        An important class of transformations for outer joins aims at identifying conditions where outer joins
        can be replaced by inner joins

        The *redundancy rule* ,introduced in [[cite:&213169]], is an example of such a rule.

        It uses the property of *null-rejecting* predicates. If a predicate \(p\) evaluates to false or
        undefined for NULL values, then \(p\) is said to be null-rejecting. For example, consider the
        predicate \(S.a > 10\). Since it evaluates to false when S.a is NULL, the predicate is null-rejecting.
        Intuitively, if the ancestor operator of an outer join contains a null-rejecting predicate on a column
        with padded NULLs introduced by the outer join, then the outer join can be rewritten as an inner join
        without changing the result.

        For example, \(\sigma_{S.a>10}(R\leftarrow_{R_k=S_k}S)\) can be rewritten as
        \(\sigma_{S.a>10}(R\bowtie_{R_k=S_k}S)\)

SELECT student, SUM(end - start) AS TotalCourseTime
FROM StudentClass AS S INNER JOIN ClassSchedule AS C
ON S.class = C.class
GROUP BY student

*** Complete group-by push-down
        The necessary and sufficient conditions for a group-by operator \(GBY\) on top of \(R_1\bowtie R_2\)
        to be eligible for a complete one-sided group-by push-down to \(R_2\) with a group-by operator
        \(GBY'\) atop \(R_2\) are presented in [[cite:&10.1145/375663.375748]]:
        1. All aggregate functions specified in the group-by operator \(GBY\) only uses columns from \(R_2\)
        2. A primary key of \(R_1\) is a subset of the grouping columns of \(GBY\).
        3. The grouping columns of the group-by operator \(GBY'\) is the union of grouping columns of \(GBY\)
           and the equi-join columns of \(R_2\) in \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) . The specification of the aggregations
           in \(GBY'\) is identical to those in \(GBY\)

        * Without the first condition, no one-sided push-down of the group-by with elimination of the group-by
          above join is possible as columns of \(R_1\) are not available to \(GBY'\).
        * Without the second condition, it will be possible for a single tuple of \(R_1\) to be part of two or
          more different groups in the final output (and thus contribute to aggregated values in multiple
          distinct groups). If that were the case, multiple groups in \(GBY'\) will need to be coalesced and
          thus GBY cannot be eliminated.
        * The last condition ensures that no tuples that would have been eliminated during the join
          \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) are used in producing aggregate results.
          As we will see later, the strategy of *fattening* the set of grouping columns leveraged in the third
          condition will be essential when we discuss partial group-by push-down later in this section.

        The complete group-by push-down transformation applies to all /aggregate functions, including user
        defined functions/.

        The opportunity for complete group-by push-down often occurs in the context of primary-key-foreign-key
        joins. Interestingly, a special case of complete group-by push-down is when the grouping columns of
        \(GBY\) contain the foreign key of \(R_1\) , where the third condition becomes redundant. In such
        cases, the specifications of \(GBY\) and \(GBY ′\) are identical. This special case is referred to as
        *invariant grouping* [[cite:&10.5555/645920.672834]]. For example, in the following Query:
        #+begin_src sql
-- Q11
SELECT SUM(R.a)
FROM R INNER JOIN S
ON R.fk = S.k
GROUP BY S.k, R.fk
        #+end_src

        When \(R.fk\) is a foreign key of \(R\) and \(S.k\) is the primary key of \(S\), the group-by operator
        can be pushed down to \(R\) and the aggregate \(SUM\) on \(R.a\) is computed for each group prior to
        joining with \(S\). Figure ref:f4.12 shows the plan before and after the group-by push-down.

*** Partial group-by push-down
        When all aggregate functions specified in the group-by operator \(GBY\) over \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) still
        only use columns from one of the operands \(R_2\) of the join (i.e., the first condition for complete
        group-by push-down is satisfied but not the second), there may still be opportunities to add a
        group-by operator before the join to reduce the cardinality of the input of the join.

        The *partial aggregates* (also referred to as *local* aggregates) from the added group-by operator before
        the join are combined to calculate the final *global aggregates*. However, for this to be possible, each
        aggregate function \(agg\) specified in \(GBY\) over \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) must satisfy *distributive
        properties*. Specifically, we say that the aggregation function \(agg\) satisfies the *simple
        distributive property* if the following holds:
        \begin{equation*}
        agg(S\cup S′)=agg(agg(S), agg(S′))
        \end{equation*}
        Examples of aggregate functions that satisfy this property include MIN, MAX, DISTINCT, and SUM. In
        such cases, the partial group-by push-down transformation is referred to as *simple coalescing
        grouping*. The transformation leaves \(GBY\) over \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) unchanged. The additional group-by
        operator \(GBY'\) introduced atop \(R_2\) has the same specification for the aggregates but its
        grouping columns will be the union of the join columns of \(R_2\) in \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) and the subset
        of grouping columns of \(GBY\) that are from \(R_2\) . The last condition ensures, as in condition (3)
        of complete group-by push-down that aggregations computed in \(GBY ′\) do not erroneously include
        contributions from R2 tuples that would be eliminated in the output of \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) .

        Consider
        #+begin_src sql
SELECT SUM(R.a)
FROM R INNER JOIN S
ON R.fk = S.k
GROUP BY S.b
        #+end_src

        Note that because the key of \(S\) is not part of the group-by columns, we cannot apply the complete
        group-by push-down here. Instead, we can use the partial push-down of group-by (simple coalescing
        grouping) by computing a partial aggregate of \(SUM (R.a)\) on \(R\) and then aggregate on the result
        of the join as shown in Figure ref:f4.13.

        A more general version of the distributive property for an aggregate function \(agg\) opens the door for
        more opportunities for partial group-by push-down. The required property may be stated as:
        \begin{equation*}
        agg(S\cup S')=f(agg'(S),agg'(S'),count(S),count(S'))
        \end{equation*}
        where \(agg'\) is an auxiliary aggregate function that is not necessarily the given aggregate function
        in the query, and \(f\) combines the partial aggregates into the final aggregate while leveraging the
        additional aggregate \(count\). For example,
        \begin{equation*}
        AVG(S\cup S')=\frac{SUM(S)+SUM(S')}{COUNT(S)+COUNT(S')}
        \end{equation*}
        We refer to the above case of group-by push-down as *generalized coalescing grouping*.

        For this partial group-by push-down transformation, the additional local group-by operator \(GBY'\)
        introduced above \(R_2\) (but prior to the join) has the same set of group-by columns as in the case
        of simple coalescing grouping, but each aggregation function \(agg\) is replaced by \(agg'\). In
        addition, an extra aggregation function \(count\) is added to the list of aggregation functions
        \(agg'\) . As in the case of simple coalescing grouping, the grouping columns of \(GBY′\) will be the
        union of the join columns of \(R_2\) in \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) and the subset of grouping columns of
        \(GBY\) that are from \(R_2\) . Unlike simple coalescing grouping where the specification of the
        \(GBY\) operator after \(R_1\bowtie R_2\) was unchanged, in the case of generalized coalescing
        grouping, the aggregation functions \(agg\) are changed to \(agg'\) corresponding to the computation
        needs of the global aggregate

        Consider
        #+begin_src sql
-- Q13
SELECT student, AVG(end - start) AS AvgCourseTime
FROM StudentClass AS S INNER JOIN ClassSchedule AS C
ON S.class = C.class
GROUP BY student
        #+end_src

        In this case, as shown in Figure [[ref:f4.11]]c, we can first calculate the total number of hours (hours)
        and the number of counts (cnt) per course when aggregating on the ClassSchedule table, and then join
        with the StudentClass table to produce the final global aggregate. Observe how the aggregation
        functions have been modified to support the computation of the local and global aggregates.
