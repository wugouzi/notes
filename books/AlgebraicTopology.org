* Some Underlying Geometric Notions
** Homotopy and Homotopy Type
    A *deformation retraction* of a space \(X\) onto a subspace \(A\) is a family of
    maps \(f_t:X\to X\), \(t\in I\) s.t. \(f_0=\bbone\) (the identity map), \(f_1(X)=A\),
    and \(f_t|A=\bbone\) for all \(t\). The family \(f_t\) should be continuous in the sense that
    the associated map \(X\times I\to X\), \((x,t)\mapsto f_t(x)\) is continuous

    For a map \(f:X\to Y\), the *mapping cylinder* \(M_f\) is the quotient space of the disjoint
    union \((X\times I)\coprod Y\) obtained by identifying each \((x,1)\in X\times I\) with \(f(x)\in Y\).

    A deformation retraction \(f_t:X\to X\) is a special case of the general notion of a *homotopy*,
    which is simply any family of maps \(f_t:X\to Y\), \(t\in I\), s.t. the associated map \(F:X\times I\to Y\)
    given by \(F(x,t)=f_t(x)\) is continuous. One says that two maps \(f_0,f_1:X\to Y\) are *homotopic*
    if there exists a homotopy \(f_t\) connecting them, and we writes \(f_0\simeq f_1\)

    A deformation retraction of \(X\) onto a subspace \(A\) is a homotopy from the identity map
    of \(X\) to a *retraction* of \(X\) onto \(A\), a map \(r:X\to X\) s.t. \(r(X)=A\) and \(r|A=\bbo\)

    A homotopy \(f_t:X\to Y\) whose restriction to a subspace \(A\subset X\) is independent of \(t\) is
    called a *homotopy relative to* \(A\), or more concisely, a homotopy \(\rel A\)

    If a space \(X\) deformation retracts onto a subspace \(A\) via \(f_t:X\to X\), then if \(r:X\to A\)
    denotes the resulting retraction and \(i:A\to X\) the inclusion, we have \(ri=\bbo\).
