* Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

** Topological Spaces
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A *topology* on a set is a collection \(\calt\) of subsets of \(X\) having the following properties
   1. \(\emptyset\) and \(X\) are in \(\calt\)
   2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of \(\calt\) is in \(T\)
   3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of \(\calt\) is in \(\calt\)


   A set \(X\) for which a topology \(\calt\) has been specified is called a *topological space*
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   Consider \(\bigcap_{n\in\N}(-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n})=\{0\}\). \((-1/n,1/n)\) is open but \(\{0\}\) is not
   open in \(\R\).
   #+END_examplle

   If \(X\)is a topological space with topology \(\calt\), we say that a subset \(U\) of \(X\) is an
   *open set* of \(X\) if \(U\in\calt\)

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   If \(X\) is any set, the collection of all subsets of \(X\) is a topology on \(X\); it is called
   the *discrete topology*. The collection consisting of \(X\) and \(\emptyset\) only is also a topology
   on \(X\); we shall call it the *indiscrete topology*
   #+END_examplle

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   Let \(X\) be a set; let \(\calt_f\) be the collection of all subsets \(U\) of \(X\)s.t. \(X-U\)
   either is finite or is all of \(X\). Then \(\calt_f\) is a topology on \(X\), called the *finite
   complement topology*. If \(\{U_\alpha\}\) is an indexed family of nonempty elements of \(\calt_f\).
   \begin{equation*}
   X-\bigcup U_\alpha=\bigcap(X-U_\alpha)
   \end{equation*}
   #+END_examplle


   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Suppose that \(\calt\) and \(\calt'\) are two topology on a given set \(X\). If \(\calt'\supset\calt\) we say
   that \(\calt'\) is *finer* than \(\calt\); if \(\calt'\) properly contains \(\calt\) we say that \(\calt'\)  is
   *strictly finer* than \(\calt\). We say that \(\calt\) is *coarser* than \(\calt'\) or *strictly coarser*. We
   say \(\calt\) is *comparable* with \(\calt\) is either \(\calt'\supset\calt\) or \(\calt\supset\calt'\)
   #+END_definition

** Basis for a Topology
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   If \(X\) is a set, a *basis* for a topology on \(X\) is a collection \(\calb\) of subsets of \(X\)
   (called *basis element*) s.t.
   1. for each \(x\in X\), there is at least one basis element \(B\) s.t. \(x\in B\)
   2. if \(x\in B_1\cap B_2\), then there is a basis element \(B_3\) s.t. \(x\in B_3\subset B_1\cap B_2\)


   If \(\calb\) satisfies these conditions, then we define the *topology \(\calt\) generated by \(\calb\)* as
   follows: A subset \(U\) of \(X\) is said to be open in \(X\) if for each \(x\in U\), there is a
   basis \(B\in\calb\) s.t. \(x\in B\subset U\).
   #+END_definition

   Now we show that \(\calt\) is indeed a topology. Take an indexed family \(\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in J}\) of elements
   of \(\calt\), we show that
   \begin{equation*}
   U=\bigcup_{\alpha\in J}U_\alpha
   \end{equation*}
   belongs to \(\calt\). Given \(x\in U\), there is an index \alpha s.t. \(x\in U_\alpha\). Since \(U_\alpha\) is open,
   there is a basis element \(B\) s.t. \(x\in B\subset U_\alpha\). Then \(x\in B\) and \(B\subset U\), so \(U\) is open.

   If \(U_1,U_2\in \calt\), then given \(x\in U_1\cap U_2\). we choose \(x\in B_1\subset U_1\) and \(x\in B_2\subset U_2\). By the
   second condition  for a basis we have \(x\in B_3\subset B_1\cap B_2\). Hence \(x\in B_3\subset U_1\cap U_2\).

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   Let \(X\) be a set; let \(\calb\) be a basis for a topology \(\calt\) on \(X\). Then \(\calt\) equals the
   collection of all unions of elements of \(\calb\).
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Given a collection of elements of \(\calb\), they are also elements of \(\calt\). Because \(\calt\) is a
   topology, their union is in \(\calt\).

   Conversely, given \(U\in\calt\), choose for each \(x\in U\) an element \(B_x\) for \(B\)
   s.t. \(x\in B_x\subset U\). Then \(U=\bigcup_{x\in U}B_x\)

   label:lemma13.2
   Let \(X\) be a topological space. Suppose that \(\calc\) is a collection of open sets of \(X\) s.t.
   for each open set \(U\) of \(X\) and each \(x\) in \(U\), there is an element \(C\) of \(\calc\)
   s.t. \(x\in C\subseteq U\). Then \(\calc\) is a basis for the topology of \(X\).
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(x\in C_1\cap C_2\), since \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) is open, \(C_1\cap C_2\) is open. Hence there
   exists \(C_3\in\calc\) s.t. \(x\in C_3\subseteq C_1\cap C_2\)

   Let \(\calt\) be the collection of open sets of \(X\); we must show that the topology \(\calt'\)
   generated by \(\calc\) equals the topology \(\calt\). If \(U\in\calt\), then there is \(x\in C\subset U\). If \(W\in\calt'\),
   then \(W=\bigcup_{x\in W} B_x\) and \(B_x\in\calt\)

   2. For each \(x\in X\) and each basis element \(x\in B\in\calb\) there is a basis element \(B'\in\calb'\)
      s.t. \(x\in B'\subset B\)

   #+BEGIN_definition
   If \(\calb\) is the collection of all open intervals in the real line
   \begin{equation*}
   (a,b)=\{x\mid a<x<b\}
   \end{equation*}
   the topology generated by \(\calb\) is called the *standard topology* on the real line. If \(\calb'\) is
   the collection of all half-opne intervals of the form
   \begin{equation*}
   [a,b)=\{x\mid a\le x<b\}
   \end{equation*}
   where \(a<b\), the topology generated by \(\calb'\) is called the *lower limit topology* of \(\R\).
   When \(\R\) is given the lower limit topology, we denote it by \(\R_l\). Finally let \(K\) denote
   the set of all numbers of the form \(1/n\) for \(n\in\Z_+\), and let \(\calb''\) be the collection of all
   open intervals \((a,b)\) along with all sets of the form \((a,b)-K\). The topology generated
   by \(\calb''\) is called the *\(K\)-topology* on \(R\). When \(\R\) is given this topology, we denote it
   by \(\R_K\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   The topologies of \(\R_l\) and \(\R_K\) are strictly finer than the standard topology on \(\R\), but
   are not comparable with one another.
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(\calt,\calt',\calt''\) be the topologies of \(\R,\R_l,\R_K\). Given a basis element \((a,b)\) for \(\calt\)
   and a point \(x\) of \((a,b)\), the basis element \(x\in[x,b)\subset(a,b)\). On the other hand, given the
   basis element \([x,d)\in\calt\)  there is no interval \((a,b)\) that contains \(x\) and lies
   in \([x,d)\). Thus \(\calt\) is strictly finer than \(\calt\).

   Given \(B=(-1,1)-K\in\calt''\) and the point 0 of \(B\), there is no open interval of \(\calt\) that
   contains 0 and lies in \(B\)

   Also given \(B\), there is no \([x,b)\in\calt'\)  s.t. \([x,b)\subset B\).

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A *subbasis* \(\cals\) for a topology on \(X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) whose union
   equals \(X\). The *topology generated by the subbasis* \(\cals\) is defined to be the collection \(\calt\)
   of all unions of finite intersection of elements of \(\cals\).
   #+END_definition

** The Order Topology
   Given elements _\(a\) and \(b\) of \(X\)_ s.t. \(a<b\),\((a,b)\),\((a,b]\),\([a,b)\) and \([a,b]\)
   are *intervals*

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(X\) be a set with a simple order relation; assume \(X\) has more than one element.
   Let \(\calb\) be the collection of all sets of the following types:
   1. All open intervals \((a,b)\) in \(X\)
   2. All intervals of the form \([a_0,b)\) where \(a_0\) is the smallest element of \(X\)
   3. All intervals of the form \((a,b_0]\) where \(b_0\) is the largest element of \(X\)


   The collection \(\calb\) is a basis for a topology on \(X\), which is called the *order topology*

** The Product Topology on \texorpdfstring{$X\times Y$}{X Y}

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. The *product topology* on \(X\times Y\) is the topology
   having as basis the collection \(\calb\) of all sets of the form \(U\times V\), where \(U\) is an open
   subset of \(X\) and \(V\) is an open subset of \(Y\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   If \(\calb\) is a basis for the topology of \(X\) and \(\calc\) is a basis for the topology of \(Y\),

   \begin{equation*}
   \cals=\{\pi_1^{-1}(U)\mid U\text{ open in }X\}\cup\{\pi_2^{-1}(V)\mid V\text{ open in }Y\}

   is a subbasis for the product topology on \(X\times Y\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .7\textwidth
   [[../images/Topology/1.png]]

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(\calt\) denote the product topology on \(X\times Y\); let \(\calt'\) be the topology generated by \(\cals\).
   Then \(\calt'\subset \calt\). On the other hand, every basis element \(U\times V\) for the topology \(\calt\) is a
   finite intersection of elements of \(\cals\), since
   \begin{equation*}
   U\times V=\pi_1^{-1}\cap\pi_2^{-1}(V)
   \end{equation*}
   Hence \(U\times V\in\calt\)
   #+END_proof


** The Subspace Topology
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\calt\). If \(Y\subseteq X\), then
   \begin{equation*}
   \calt_Y=\{Y\cap U\mid U\in\calt\}
   \end{equation*}
   is a topology on \(Y\), called the *subspace topology*. With this topology, \(Y\) is called a
   *subspace* of \(X\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   if \(\calb\) is a basis for the topology of \(X\) then the collection
   \begin{equation*}
   \calb_Y=\{B\cap Y\mid B\in\calb\}
   \end{equation*}
   is a basis for the subspace topology on \(Y\)
   #+END_lemma

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Given \(U\) open in \(X\) and given \(y\in U\cap Y\), we can choose an element \(B\) of \(\calb\) s.t
   . \(y\in B\subset U\). Then \(y\in B\cap Y\subset U\cap Y\). It follows from Lemma ref:lemma13.2 that \(\calb_Y\) is a
   basis for the subspace topology on \(Y\)
   #+END_proof

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_lemma
   Let \(Y\) be a subspace of \(X\). If \(U\) is open in \(Y\) and \(Y\) is open in \(X\),
   then \(U\) is open in \(X\)
   #+END_lemma

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   if \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\) and \(B\) is a subspace of \(Y\), then the product topology
   on \(A\times B\) is the same as the topology \(A\times B\) inherits as a subspace of \(X\times Y\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
    The set \(U\times V\) is the general basis element for \(X\times Y\), where \(U,V\) are open in \(X,Y\)
    respectively.  Therefore \((U\times V)\cap(A\times B)\) is the general basis element for the subspace
    topology on \(A\times B\). Now
    \begin{equation*}
   (U\times V)\cap(A\times B)=(U\cap A)\times (V\cap B)
    \end{equation*}
   #+END_proof

   Now let \(X\) be an ordered set in the order topology, and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\). The
   order relation on \(X\), when restricted to \(Y\), makes \(Y\) into an ordered set. However the
   resulting order topology on Y need not be the same as the topology that Y inherits as a subspace
   of X

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_examplle
   Consider the subset \(Y=[0,1]\) of the real line \(\R\) in the /subspace/ topology. Given \((a,b)\)
   \begin{equation*}
   (a,b)\cap Y=
   \begin{cases}
   &(a,b)\\
   &[0,b)\\
   &(a,1]\\
   &Y\text{ or }\emptyset
   \end{cases}
   \end{equation*}
   Sets of the second and third types are not open in the larger space \(\R\)

   Note that these sets form a basis for the /order/  topology on \(Y\). Thus we see that in the case
   of the set \(Y=[0,1]\) its subspace topology and its order topology are the same
   #+END_examplle

   Given an ordered set \(X\), a subset \(Y\) of \(X\) is *convex* in \(X\) if for each pair of
   points \(a<b\) of \(Y\), the entire interval \((a,b)\) of points of \(X\) lies in \(Y\). Note
   that intervals and rays in \(X\) are convex in \(X\)

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   Let \(X\) be an ordered set in the order topology; let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\) that is convex
   in \(X\). Then the order topology on \(Y\) is the same as the topology \(Y\) inherits as a
   subspace of \(X\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Consider the ray \((a,+\infty)\) in \(X\). If \(a\in Y\) then
   \begin{equation*}
   (a,+\infty)\cap Y=\{x\mid x\in Y\text{ and }x>a\}
   \end{equation*}
   this is an open ray of the ordered set \(Y\). If \(a\not\in Y\), then \(a\) is either a lower bound
   on \(Y\) or an upper bound on \(Y\), since \(Y\) is convex. In the former case, \((a,+\infty)\cap Y=Y\);
   in the latter case, it is empty

   Similarly, \((-\infty,a)\cap Y\) is either an open ray of \(Y\), or \(Y\) itself, or empty. Since the
   sets \((a,+\infty)\cap Y\) and \((-\infty,a)\cap Y\) form a subbasis for the subspace topology on \(Y\), and
   since each is open in the order topology,and since each is open in the order topology,
   the order topology contains the subspace topology

   To prove the reverse, note that any open ray of \(Y\) equals the intersection of an open ray
   of \(X\) with \(Y\), so it is open in the subspace topology on \(Y\). Since the open rays
   of \(Y\) are a subbasis for the order topology, this topology is contained in the subspace topology

** Closed Sets and Limit Points

   In an arbitrary topological space, one says that a sequence \(x_1,x_2,\dots\) of points of the
   space \(X\) *converges* to the point \(x\) of \(X\) provided that, corresponding to each
   neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) there is a positive integer \(N\) s.t. \(x_n\in U\) for all \(n\ge N\).
   In \(\R\) and \(\R^2\) a sequence cannot converge to more than one point, but in an arbitrary space,
   it can. In Figure ref:fig:17.3 the sequence defined by setting \(x_n=b\) converges not only to
   the point \(b\) but also to the point \(a\) and \(c\).

   A topological space \(X\) is called a *Hausdorff space* if for each pair \(x_1,x_2\) of disjoint
   points of \(X\), there exist neighborhoods \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) of \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) respectively,

   Every fintie point set in a Hausdorff space \(X\) is closed.
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   It suffices to show that every one-point set \(\{x_0\}\) is closed.
   #+END_proof

   The condition that finite point sets be closed is in fact weaker than the Hausdorff condition.
   For example, the real line \(\R\) in the finite complement topology is not a Hausdorff space, but
   it is a space in which finite point sets are closed. The condition that finite point sets be
   closed is called the *\(T_1\) axiom*

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   Let \(X\) be a space satisfying the \(T_1\) axiom; let \(A\) be a subset of \(X\). Then the
   point \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) iff every neighborhood of \(x\) contains infinitely many points
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) and suppose some neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) intersects \(A\)
   in only finitely many points. Then \(U\) also intersects \(A-\{x\}\) in finitely many points;
   let \(\{x_1,\dots,x_m\}\) be the points of \(U\cap(A-\{x\})\). The set \(X-\{x_1,\dots,x_m\}\) is an open set
   of \(X\), then
   \begin{equation*}
   U\cap(X-\{x_1,\dots,x_m\})
   \end{equation*}
   is a neighborhood of \(x\) that intersects the set \(A-\{x\}\)

   If \(X\) is the Hausdorff space, then a sequence of points of \(X\) converges to at most one
   point of \(X\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Suppose that \(x_n\) is a sequence of points of \(X\) that converges to \(x\). If \(y\neq x\)
   let \(U\) and \(V\) be disjoint neighborhoods of \(x\) and \(y\) respectively. Since \(U\)
   contains \(x_n\) for all but finitely many values of \(n\), the set \(V\) cannot.
   Therefore \(x_n\) cannot converge to \(y\).
   #+END_proof

   If the sequence \(x_n\) of points of the Hausdorff space \(X\) converges to the point \(x\)
   of \(X\), we often write \(x_n\to x\) and we say that \(x\) is the *limit* of the sequence \(x_n\)

** Continuous Functions
   Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. A function \(f:X\to Y\) is said to be *continuous* if for
   each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\) the set \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of \(X\).

   Let's note that if the topology of the range space \(Y\) is given by a basis \(\calb\), then to prove
   continuity of \(f\) it suffices to show that the inverse image of every /basis element/ is oepn.

   If the topology on \(Y\) is given by a subbasis \(\cals\), to prove continuity of \(f\) it will even
   suffice to show that the inverse of each /subbasis/ element is open.

   Given \(x_0\in\R\)  and given \(\epsilon>0\) the interval \(V=(f(x_0)-\epsilon,f(x_0)+\epsilon)\) is an open set of the

   Because \(x_0\in f^{-1}(V)\), it contains some basis element \((a,b)\) about \(x_0\). We choose
   \delta to be the smaller of the two numbers \(x_0-a\) and \(b-x_0\). Then if \(\abs{x-x_0}<\delta\), the

   function \(f\) and the inverse function
   \begin{equation*}
   f^{-1}:Y\to X

   Suppose that \(f:X\to Y\) is an injective continuous map, where \(X\) and \(Y\) are topological
   spaces. Let \(Z\) be the image set \(f(X)\), considered as a subspace of \(Y\); then the
   function \(f':X\to Z\) obtained by restricting the range of \(f\)  is bijectiive. If \(f'\) happens
   to be a homeomorphism of \(X\) with \(Z\), we say that the map \(f:X\to Y\) is a

   distinct indices from the index set \(J\), and let \(U_{\beta_i}\) be an open set in \(X_{\beta_i}\)

   Now we consider the infinite cartesian product \(\R^\omega\). It is natural to try to generalize the
   metrics \(d\) and ρ to this space. For instance, one can attempt to define a metric \(d\)
   on \(\R^\omega\) by the equation

   \begin{equation*}
   d(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^\infty(x_i-y_i)^2}
   \end{equation*}
   But this equation does not always make sense, for the series in question need not converge. (This
   equation does define a metric on a certain important subset of \(\R^\omega\), however; see the
   exercises.)

   Similarly, one can attempt to generalize the square metric ρ to \(\R^\omega\) by defining
   \begin{equation*}
   \rho(x,y)=\sup\{\abs{x_n-y_n}\}
   \end{equation*}
   Again, this formula does not always make sense. If however we replace the usual
   metric \(d(x,y)=\abs{x-y}\) on \(\R\) by its bounded counterpart \(\bard(x,y)=\min\{\abs{x-y},1\}\), then
   this definition does make sense; it gives a metric on \(\R^\omega\) called the /uniform metric/

   We shall prove that the product of two compact spaces is compact;

   Suppose we are given spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), with \(Y\) compact. Suppose that \(x_0\) is a point
   of \(X\), and \(N\) is an open set of \(X\times Y\) containing \(x_0\times Y\). We prove the following
   \begin{quoting}
   There is a neighborhood \(W\) of \(x_0\) in \(X\) s.t. \(N\) contains the entire set \(W\times Y\)
   \end{quoting}

   The set \(W\times Y\) is often called a *tube* about \(x_0\times Y\)

   First let's cover \(x_0\times Y\) by basis elements \(U\times V\) (for the topology of \(X\times Y\)), lying
   in \(N\). The space \(x_0\times Y\)  is compact, being homeomorphic to \(Y\). Therefore, we can
   cover \(x_0\times Y\) by finitely many such basis elements
   \begin{equation*}
   U_1\times V_1,\dots,U_n\times V_n
   \end{equation*}
   (We assume that each of the basis elements \(U_i\times V_i\)) actually intersects \(x_0\times Y\). Define
   \begin{equation*}
   W=U_1\cap\dots\cap U_n
   \end{equation*}
   \(W\) is open and it contains \(x_0\) because each set \(U_i\times V_i\) intersects \(x_0\times Y\).

   We assert that the sets \(U_i\times V_i\), which were chosen to cover the slice \(x_0\times Y\), actually
   cover the tube \(W\times Y\). Let \(x\times y\in W\times Y\). Consider the point \(x_0\times y\) of the
   slice \(x_0\times Y\) having the same \(y\)-coordinate as this point. Now \(x_0\times y\in U_i\times V_i\) for
   some \(i\), so that \(y\in V_i\). But \(x\in U_j\) for every \(j\). Therefore we

   Now we prove the theorem. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be compact spaces. Let \(\cala\) be an open covering
   of \(X\times Y\). Given \(x_0\in X\), the slice \(x_0\times Y\) is compact and may therefore be covered by
   finitely many elements \(A_1,\dots,A_m\in\cala\). \(N=A_1\cup\dots\cup A_m\) is an open set containing \(x_0\times Y\).

   The open set \(N\) contains a tube \(W\times Y\) about \(x_0\times Y\) where \(W\) is open in \(X\).
   Then \(W\times Y\) is covered by finitely many elements \(A_1,\dots,A_m\in\cala\).

   Thus for each \(x\in X\), we can choose a neighborhood \(W_x\) of \(x\) s.t. the tube \(W_x\times Y\) can
   be covered by finitely many elements of \(\cala\). The collection of all the neighborhoods \(W_x\) is
   an open covering of \(X\); therefore by compactness of \(X\), there exists a finite subcollection

   /Step 1/. Given \(a<b\), let \(\cala\) be a covering of \([a,b]\) by sets open in \([a,b]\) in the
   subspace topology (which is the same as the order topology). First we prove the following
   \begin{quoting}
   If \(x\in[a,b]\) different from \(b\), then there is a point \(y>x\) of \([a,b]\) s.t. the interval \([x,y]\) can
   be covered by at most two elements of \(\cala\).
   \end{quoting}

   If \(x\) has an immediate successor in \(X\), let \(y\) be this immediate successor.
   Then \([x,y]\) has two points \(x,y\). If \(x\) has no immediate successor in \(X\), choose an
   element \(A\in\cala\) containing \(x\). Because \(x\neq b\) and \(A\) is open, \(A\) contains an interval
   of the form \([x,c)\) for some \(c\in[a,b]\). Choose a point \(y\in(x,c)\), then \([x,y]\) can be
   covered by \(A\).

   /Step 2/. Let \(C\) be the set of all points \(y>a\) of \([a,b]\) s.t. the interval \([a,y]\) can
   be covered by finitely many elements of \(\cala\). Applying Step 1 to the case \(x=a\), we see that
   there exists at least one such \(y\), so \(C\) is not empty. Let \(c\) be the least upper bound
   of the set \(C\); then \(a<c\le b\)

   /Step 3/. We show that \(c\in C\). Choose an element \(A\in\cala\) containing \(c\). Since \(A\) is open,
   it contains an interval of the form \((d,c]\) for some \(d\in[a,b]\). It \(c\not\in C\), there must
   be a point \(z\in C\) lying in the interval \((d,c)\), because otherwise \(d\)would be a smaller
   upper bound on \(C\) than \(c\). Since \(z\in C\), the interval \([a,z]\) can be covered by
   finitely many, say \(n\), elements of \(\cala\). Now \([z,c]\) lies in the single elements \(A\)
   of \(\cala\), hence \([a,c]=[a,z]\cup[z,c]\) can be covered by \(n+1\) elements of \(\cala\). Thus \(c\in C\)

   /Step 4/. Finally we show that \(c=b\). Suppose \(c<b\), applying Step 1 to the case \(x=c\) we
   conclude that there exists a point \(y>c\) of \([a,b]\) s.t. the interval \([c,y]\) can be
   covered by finitely many elements of \(\cala\).  By Step 3, \([a,y]\) can be covered by finitely many
   elements of \(\cala\). This means that \(y\in C\), a contradiction

   Let \(X\) be a compact space. We prove the contrapositive - if \(A\) has no limit point,
   then \(A\) must be finite

   Suppose \(A\) has no limit point. Then \(A\) contains all its limit points, so that \(A\) is
   closed ([[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/512769/help-in-proof-of-compactness-implies-limit-point-compactness][this might help]]). Furthermore for each \(a\in A\) we choose a neighborhood \(U_a\) of \(a\)
   s.t. \(U_a\) intersects \(A\) in the point \(a\) alone (negation of the definition of limit
   point). The space \(X\) is covered by the open
   set \(X-A\) and the open sets \(U_a\). By compactness, it can be covered by finitely many of these
   sets. Since \(X-A\) doesn't intersect \(A\), and each set \(U_a\) contains only one point

   Let \(X\) be a space. Then \(X\) is locally compact Hausdorff iff there exists a space \(Y\)
   satisfying the following conditions
   1. \(X\) is a subspace of \(Y\)
   2. The set \(Y-X\) consists of a single point
   3. \(Y\) is a compact Hausdorff space


   If \(Y\) and \(Y'\) are two spaces satisfying these conditions, then there is a homeomorphism
   of \(Y\) with \(Y'\) that equals the identity map on \(X\)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   /Step 1/ .We first verify uniqueness. Let \(Y\) and \(Y'\) be two spaces satisfying these
   conditions. Define \(h:Y\to Y'\) by letting \(h\) map the single point \(p\in Y-X\) to the
   point p\(q\in Y'-X\), and letting \(h\) equal the identity on \(X\). We show that if \(U\) is open
   in \(Y\), then \(h(U)\) is open in \(Y'\).

   If \(p\not\in U\), then \(h(U)=U\). Since \(U\) is open in \(Y\) and is contained in \(X\), it is
   open in \(X\). Because \(X\) is open in \(Y'\) (???), \(U\) is also open in \(Y'\)

   Suppose that \(p\in U\). Since \(C=Y-U\) is closed in \(Y\), it's compact as a subspace of \(Y\).
   Because \(C\) is contained in \(X\), it is a compact subspace of \(X\). Then because \(X\) is a
   subspace of \(Y'\), the space \(C\) is also a compact subspace of \(Y'\). Because \(Y'\) is
   Hausdorff, \(C\) is closed in \(Y'\), so that \(h(U)=Y'-C\) is open in \(Y'\)

   /Step 2/. Now we suppose \(X\) is locally compact Hausdorff and construct the space \(Y\). Step 1
   gives us an idea how to proceed. Let's take some object that is not a point of \(X\), denote it
   by the symbol \(\infty\) for convenience, and adjoin it to \(X\), forming the set \(Y=X\cup\{\infty\}\).
   Topologize \(Y\) by defining the collection of open sets of \(Y\) to consist of
   1. all sets \(U\) that are open in \(X\)
   2. all sets of the form \(Y-C\), where \(C\) is a compact subspace of \(X\)


   Check:
   \begin{gather*}
   U_1\cap U_2\\
   (Y-C_1)\cap(Y-C_2)=Y-(C_1\cup C_2)\\
   U_1\cap(Y-C_1)=U_1\cap(X-C_1)
   \end{gather*}
   and
   \begin{gather*}
   \bigcup U_\alpha=U\\
   \bigcup(Y-C_\beta)=Y-(\bigcup C_\beta)=Y-C\\
   (\bigcup U_\alpha)\cup(\bigcup(Y-C_\beta))=U\cup(Y-C)=Y-(C-U)
   \end{gather*}
   \(C-U\) is a closed subspace of \(C\) and therefore compact.

   Now we show that \(X\) is a subspace of \(Y\). Given any open set of \(Y\), we show its
   intersection with \(X\) is open in \(X\).  If \(U\) is of type 1, then \(U\cap X=U\); if \(Y-C\) is
   of type 2, then \((Y-C)\cap X=X-C\); both of these sets are open in \(X\). Conversely, any set open
   in \(X\) is a set of type 1.

   To show \(Y\) is compact, let w\(\cala\) be an open covering of \(Y\). The collection \(\cala\) must
   contain an open set of type 2, say \(Y-C\). Take all the members of \(\cala\) different from \(Y-C\)
   and intersect them with \(X\); they form a collection of open sets of \(X\) covering \(C\).
   Because \(C\) is compact, finitely many of them cover \(C\); the corresponding finite collection
   of elements of \(\cala\) will, along with the element \(Y-C\), cover all of \(Y\)

   To show \(Y\) is Hausdorff, let \(x\) and \(y\) be two points of \(Y\). If both of them lie
   in \(X\), there are disjoint open sets \(U\ni x\) and \(V\ni y\) of \(X\). On the other hand,
   if \(x\in X\) and \(y=\infty\), we can choose a compact set \(C\) in \(X\) containing a
   neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\). Then \(U\) and \(Y-C\) are disjoint neighborhoods of \(x\)
   and \(\infty\).

   /Step 3/. Finally we prove the converse. Suppose a space \(Y\) satisfying conditions 1-3 exists.
   Then \(X\) is Hausdorff because it is a subspace of the Hausdorff space \(Y\). Given \(x\in X\) we
   show \(X\) is locally compact at \(x\). Choose disjoint open sets \(U\) and \(V\) of \(Y\)
   containing \(x\) and the single point of \(Y-X\), respectively. Then the set \(C=Y-V\) is closed
   in \(Y\), so it is a compact subspace of \(Y\). Since \(C\) lies in \(X\), it is also compact as
   a subspace of \(X\); it contains the neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\)

   If \(f\) and \(f'\) are continuous maps of the space \(X\) into the space \(Y\), we say

   \begin{equation*}
   F(x,0)=f(x) \quad\text{ and }\quad
   F(x,1)=f'(x)
   \end{equation*}
   for each \(x\). (Here \(I=[0,1]\)) The map \(F\) is called a *homotopy* between \(f\) and \(f'\).
   If \(f\) is homotopic to \(f'\), we write \(f\simeq f'\). If \(f\simeq f'\) and \(f'\) is a constant map,

   #+END_definition

   We think of a homotopy as a continuous one-parameter family of maps from \(X\) to \(Y\) . If we

   "deforming"  of the map \(f\) to the map \(f'\), as \(t\) goes from 0 to 1.

   Now we consider the special case where \(f\) is a path in \(X\). Suppose \(f:[0,1]\to X\)
   with \(f(0)=x_0\) and \(f(1)=x_1\), we also say that \(x_0\) is the *initial point* and \(x_1\) the
