    The *order* \(\abs{G}\) of a group is its cardinality. A finite group whose order is a power of a
    prime \(p\) is called a *\(p\)-group*

    \(C_n\) denote any cyclic group of order \(n\)

    \begin{equation*}
    a^4=e,\quad a^2=b^2,\quad bab^{-1}=a^3

    The subgroup of \(\GL_2(\fC)\) generated by \(a\) and \(b\) is
    \begin{equation*}
    Q=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,b,ab,a^2b,a^3b\}

    The group \(Q\) can also be described as the subset \(\{\pm 1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k\}\) of the quaternion
    algebra \(\H\). Recall that

    Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field \(F\). A bilinear form on \(V\) is a
    mapping \(\phi:V\times V\to F\) that is linear in each variable. An *automorphism* of such a \phi is an
    isomorphism \(\alpha:V\to V\) s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    \phi(\alpha v,\alpha w)=\phi(v,w)\text{ for all }v,w\in V
    \end{equation*}
    The automorphism of \phi form a group \(\Aut(\phi)\). Let \(\{e_1,\dots,e_n\}\) be a basis for \(V\), and let
    \begin{equation*}
    P=(\phi(e_i,e_j))_{1\le i,j\le n}
    \end{equation*}
    be the matrix of \phi. The choice of the basis identifies \(\Aut(\phi)\) with the group of invertible
    matrices \(A\) s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    A^T\cdot P\cdot A=P
    \end{equation*}

    When \phi is symmetric, i.e.,
    \begin{equation*}
    \phi(v,w)=\phi(w,v)\text{ all }v,w\in V
    \end{equation*}
    and nondegenerate, \(\Aut(\phi)\) is called the *orthogonal group* of \phi

    of \(M\) is a *basis* of \(M\) if it generates \(M\) and
    \begin{equation*}
    \sum m_ix_i=0,m_i\in\Z\Longrightarrow m_ix_i=0\text{ for every }i

    #+BEGIN_proof
    We argue by induction on \(s=c_1+\dots+c_k\). The lemma certainly holds if \(s=1\), and so we

    * \((c_1-c_2)+c_2+\dots+c_k<s\)


    and so, by induction, there exist generators \(y_1,\dots,y_k\) for \(M\) s.t.
    \begin{align*}
    y_1&=(c_1-c_2)x_1+c_2(x_1+x_2)+c_3x_3+\dots+c_kx_k\\

    Induction on the generators of \(M\).

    Among the generating sets \(\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}\) for \(M\) with \(k\) elements there is one for which
    the order of \(x_1\) is the smallest possible. We shall show that \(M\) is the direct sum
    of \(\la x_1\ra\) and \(\la x_2,\dots,x_k\ra\)

    If \(M\) is not the direct sum of \(\la x_1\ra\) and \(\la x_2,\dots,x_k\ra\), then there exists a relation
    \begin{equation*}
    m_1x_1+\dots+m_kx_k=0
    \end{equation*}
    with \(m_1x_1\neq 0\). After possibly changing the sign of some of the \(x_i\), we may suppose
    that \(m_1,\dots,m_k\in\N\) and \(m_1<\order(x_1)\). Let \(d=\gcd(m_1,\dots,m_k)>0\), and let \(c_i=m_i/d\).
    According to the lemma, there exists a generating set \(y_1,\dots,y_k\) s.t. \(y_1=c_1x_1+\dots+c_kx_k\).
    But
    \begin{equation*}
    dy_1=m_1x_1+\dots+m_kx_k=0

    A nonzero finitely generated commutative group \(M\) can be expressed
    \begin{equation*}
    M\approx C_{n_1}\times\cdots\times C_{n_s}\times C_\infty^r
    \end{equation*}
    for certain integers \(n_1,\dots,n_s\ge 2\) and \(r\ge 0\). Moreover
    1. \(r\) is uniquely determined by \(M\)
    2. the \(n_i\) can be chosen so that \(n_1\ge 2\) and \(n_1\mid n_2,\dots,n_{s-1}\mid n_s\), and then they are
       uniquely determined by \(M\)
    3. the \(n_i\) can be chosen to be powers of prime numbers, and then they are uniquely determined
       by \(M\)
    #+END_theorem

    The number \(r\) is called the *rank* of \(M\). By \(r\) being uniquely determined by \(M\), we
    mean that two decompositions of \(M\) of the form , the number of copies of \(C_\infty\) will be the
    same. The integers in (2) are called the *invariant factors* of \(M\). Statement (3) says
    that \(M\) can be expressed
    \begin{equation*}
    M\approx C_{p_1^{e_1}}\times\dots\times C_{p_t^{e_t}}\times C_\infty^r,\quad e_i\ge 1
    \end{equation*}
    for certain prime powers \(p_i^{e_i}\), and that the integers \(p_1^{e_1},\dots,p_t^{e_t}\) are uniquely
    determined by \(M\); they are called the *elementary divisors* of \(M\)


    #+BEGIN_proof
    The first assertion is a restatement of Theorem ref:1.54
    1. For a prime \(p\) not dividing any of the \(n_i\)
       \begin{equation*}
       M/pM\approx(C_\infty/pC_\infty)^r\cong(\Z/p\Z)^r
       \end{equation*}
       and so \(r\) is the dimension of \(M/pM\) as an \(\F_p\)-vector space
       #+LATEX: \wu{
       suppose \(C_n=\la a\ra\) and \(f:C_n\to pC_n:a\mapsto a^p\). Since \((p,n)=1\), \(\abs{a^p}=n\). Thus this
       is an isomorphism
       #+LATEX: }
    2. 3. If \(\gcd(m,n)=1\), then \(C_m\times C_n\) contains an element of order \(mn\), and so
       \begin{equation*}
       C_m\times C_n\approx C_{mn}
       \end{equation*}
       In this way we can decomposite \(C_{n_i}\) into products of cyclic groups of prime power order.
       Then we can construct what we want

       To prove the uniqueness of (2) and (3), we can replace \(M\) with its torsion subgroup (and
       so assume \(r=0\)).

       uniqueness of elementary divisors is clear.

       \(n_s\) is the smallest integer \(>0\) s.t. \(n_sM=0\); \(n_{s-1`}\) is the smallest
       integer \(>0\) s.t. \(n_{s-1}M\) is cyclic; \(n_{s-2}\) is the smallest integer
       s.t. \(n_{s-2}M\) can be expressed as a product of two cyclic groups, and so on

    For any integers \(m,n,r>1\), there exists a finite group \(G\) with elements \(a\) and \(b\)
    s.t. \(a\) has order \(m\), \(b\) has order \(n\), and \(ab\) has order \(r\)
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    We shall show that, for a suitable prime power \(q\), there exist elements \(a\) and \(b\)
    of \(\SL_2(\F_q)\) s.t. \(a,b\) and \(ab\) have orders \(2m,2n\) and \(2r\) respectively.
    As \(-I\) is the unique element of order 2 in \(\SL_2(\F_q)\), the image of \(a,b,ab\)
    in \(\SL_2(\F_q)/\{\pm I\}\) will then have orders \(m,n\) and \(r\) as required.

    Let \(p\) be the prime number not dividing \(2mnr\). Then \(p\) is a unit in the finite
    ring \(\Z/2mnr\Z\), and so some power of it, \(q\) say, is 1 in the ring. This means that \(2mnr\)
    divides \(q-1\). As the group \(\F_q^\times\) has order \(q-1\) and is cyclic (ref:1.56), there exist
    element \(u,v,w\in\F_q^{\times}\) having orders \(2m,2n\) and \(2r\) respectively. Let
    \begin{equation*}
    a=
    \begin{pmatrix}
    u&1\\0&u^{-1}

    where \(t\) has been chosen so that
    \begin{equation*}
    uv+t+u^{-1}v^{-1}=w+w^{-1}

    The characteristic polynomial of \(a\) is \((X-u)(X-u^{-1})\)

* Free Groups and Presentations; Coxeter Groups
** Free monoids
    Let \(X=\{a,b,c,\dots\}\). A *word* is a finite sequence of symbols from \(X\). Empty sequence is
    denoted by \(1\). Write \(SX\) for the set of words together with the binary concatenation.
    Then \(SX\) is a monoid, called the *free monoid* on \(X\)

    \(X\to SX\) has the following universal property: for any map of sets \(\alpha:X\to S\) from \(X\) to a
    monoid \(S\), there exists a unique homomorhism \(SX\to S\) making the diagram

** Free groups
    We want to construct a group \(FX\) contianing \(X\) and having the same universal property.
    Define
    \begin{equation*}
    X'=\{a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1},\dots\}
    \end{equation*}
    Let \(W'\) be the set of words using symbols from \(X'\). A word is *reduced* if it contains no
    pairs of the form \(aa^{-1}\) or \(a^{-1}a\). Starting with a word \(w\), we can perform a
    finite sequence of cancellations to arrive at a reduced word, which will be called the *reduced
    form* \(w_0\) of \(w\).

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_proposition
    There is only one reduced form of a word
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Induction on the length of the word \(w\). If \(w\) is reduced, there is nothing to prove.
    Otherwise a pair of the form \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) or \(a_0^{-1}a_0\) occurs - assume the first

    Observe that any two reduced forms of \(w\) obtained by a sequence of cancellations in
    which \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) is cancelled first are equal, because the induction hypothesis can be
    applied to the shorter word.

    Next observed that any reduced forms of \(w\) obtained by a sequence of cancellations
    where \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) is cancelled at some point are equal, because the result of such a
    sequence of cancellations will not be affected if \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) is cancelled first

    finally consider a reduced form \(w_0\) obtained by a sequence where no cancellation
    cancels \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) directly. Since \(a_0a_0^{-1}\) doesn't remain in \(w_0\), at least one
    of \(a_0\) or \(a_0^{-1}\) is cancelled. But the word obtained after this cancellation is the
    same as if our original pair were cancelled

    \((X,R)\) is a presentation of \(G\), and so \(G\) is finitely presented: let \(G'=\la X\mid R\ra\).
    The extension of \(a\mapsto a:X\to G\) to \(FX\) sends each element of \(R\) to 1, and therefore defines
    a homomorhism \(G'\to G\), which is obviously surjective. But every element of \(G'\) is

** Coxeter groups
    A *Coxeter system* is a pair \((G,S)\) consisting of a group \(G\) and a set of generators \(S\)

    m(s,t)\ge 2\\
    m(s,t)=m(t,s)
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    When no relation occurs between \(s\) and \(t\), we set \(m(s,t)=\infty\). Thus a Coxeter system is
    defined by a set \(S\) and a mapping
    \begin{equation*}
    m:S\times S\to\N\cup\{\infty\}

    satisfying eqref:14, and the group \(G=\la S\mid R\ra\) where
    \begin{equation*}
    R=\{(st)^{m(s,t)}\mid m(s,t)\neq\infty\}

    The *Coxeter groups* are those that arise as part of a Coxeter system. The cardinality of \(S\) is

    For \(g\in G\), the map \(i_g\) "conjugation by \(g\)"
    \begin{equation*}
    x\mapsto gxg^{-1}:G\to G
    \end{equation*}
    is an automorphism of \(G\), called an *inner automorphism* and others are called *outer*

    As \(i_{gh}(x)=(i_g\circ i_h)(x)\) and so the map \(g\mapsto i_g:G\to\Aut(G)\) is a homomorhism, its image
    is denoted by \(\Inn(G)\). It's kernel is the center of \(G\)
    \begin{equation*}

    Let \(G\) be a cyclic group of order \(n\), say \(G=\la a\ra\). Let \(m\) be an integer \(\ge 1\). The
    smallest multiple of \(m\) divisible by \(n\) is \(m\cdot\frac{n}{\gcd(m,n)}\). Therefore \(a^m\) has
    order \(\frac{n}{\gcd(m,n)}\), and so the generators of \(G\) are exactly the elements \(a^m\)
    with \(\gcd(m,n)=1\). An automorphism \alpha of \(G\) must send \(a\) to another generator of \(G\),
    and so \(\alpha(a)=a^m\) for some \(m\) relatively prime to \(n\). The map \(\alpha\mapsto m\) defines an
    isomorphism
    \begin{equation*}
    \Aut(C_n)\cong(\Z/n\Z)^{\times}
    \end{equation*}
    where
    \begin{equation*}
    (\Z/n\Z)^{\times}=\{\text{units in }\Z/n\Z\}=\{m+n\Z\mid\gcd(m,n)=1\}

    by the Chinese remainder theorem. This is an isomorphism of rings, and so

    (\Z/n\Z)^\times\cong(\Z/p_1^{r_1}\Z)^{\times}\times\dots\times(\Z/p_s^{r_s}\Z)^{\times}
    \end{equation*}
    It remains to consider the case \(n=p^r\), \(p\) prime

    Suppose first that \(p\) is odd. Then \(\{0,1,\dots,p^r-1\}\) is a complete set of representatives
    for \(\Z/p^r\Z\), and one \(p\)th of its elements are divisible by \(p\). Hence \((\Z/p^r\Z)^{\times}\) has
    order \(p^r-\frac{p^r}{p}=p^{r-1}(p-1)\). The homomorhism
    \begin{equation*}
    (\Z/p^r\Z)^\times\to(\Z/p\Z)^\times

** Characteristic subgroups
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    A *characteristic subgroup* of a group \(G\) is a subgroup \(H\) s.t. \(\alpha(H)=H\) for all
    automorphism \alpha of \(G\)
    #+END_definition

    #+BEGIN_remark
    1. Consider a group \(G\) and \(N\lhd G\). An inner automorphism of \(G\) restricts to an
       automorphism of \(N\), which may be outer. Thus a normal subgroup of \(N\) need not be a
       normal subgroup of \(G\). However, a characteristic subgroup of \(N\) will be a normal
       subgroup of \(G\). Also a characteristic subgroup of a characteristic subgroup is a
       characteristic subgroup
    2. The center \(Z(G)\) of \(G\) is a characteristic subgroup
    3. If \(H\) is the only subgroup of \(G\) of order \(m\), then it must be characteristic,
       because \(\alpha(G)\) is again a subgroup of \(G\) of order \(m\)
    4. Every subgroup of a commutative group is normal but not necessarily characteristic. For
       example, every subspace of dimension 1 in \(\F_p^2\) is a subgroup of \(\F_p^2\), but it is not
       characteristic because it is not stable under \(\Aut(\F_p^2)=\GL_2(\F_p)\)
    #+END_remark
** Semidirect products
    \(N\lhd G\). Each element \(g\in G\) defines an automorphism of \(N\), \(n\mapsto gng^{-1}\), and this
    defines a homomorhism
    \begin{equation*}
    \theta:G\to\Aut(N),\quad g\mapsto i_g\mid N
    \end{equation*}
    If there is a subgroup \(Q\) of \(G\) s.t. \(G\to G/N\) maps \(Q\) isomorphically onto \(G/N\),
    then we can construct \(G\) from \(N,Q\) and the restriction of \theta to \(Q\). Indeed, an
    element \(g\) of \(G\) can be written uniquely in the form
    \begin{equation*}
    g=nq,\quad n\in N,\quad q\in Q
    \end{equation*}
    Thus we have a one-to-one correspondence
    \begin{equation*}
    G\leftrightarrow N\times Q
    \end{equation*}
    If \(g=nq\) and \(g'=n'q'\), then
    \begin{equation*}

* Groups Acting on Sets

** Definition and examples
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    Let \(X\) be a set and let \(G\) be a group. A *left action* of \(G\) on \(X\) is a
    mapping \((g,x)\mapsto gx:G\times X\to X\) s.t.
    1. \(1x=x\), for all \(x\in X\)
    2. \((g_1g_2)x=g_1(g_2x)\), all \(g_1,g_2\in X\), \(x\in X\)


    A set together with a (left) action of \(G\) is called a (left) *\(G\)-set*. An action is *trivial*
    if \(gx=x\) for all \(g\in G\)
    #+END_definition

    The condition imply that, for each \(g\in G\), left translation by \(g\),
    \begin{equation*}
    g_L:X\to X,\quad x\mapsto gx
    \end{equation*}
    has \((g^{-1})_L\) as an inverse, and therefore \(g_L\) is a bijection, i.e., \(g_L\in Sym(X)\).
    Axiom (2) now says that
    \begin{equation}
    g\mapsto g_L:G\to\Sym(X)\label{18}
    \end{equation}
    is a homomorhism. Conversely, every such homomorhism defines an action of \(G\) on \(X\). The
    action is *faithful* (or *effective*) if the homomorhism eqref:18 is injective, i.e., if
    \begin{equation*}
    gx=x\text{ for all }x\in X\Rightarrow g=1
    \end{equation*}

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_examplle
    1. Every subgroup of the symmetric group \(S_n\) acts faithfully on \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\)
    2. Every subgroup \(H\) of a group \(G\) acts faithfully on \(G\) by left translation
       \begin{equation*}
       H\times G\to G,\quad(h,x)\mapsto hx
       \end{equation*}
    3. Let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). The group \(G\) acts on the set of left cosets of \(H\),
       \begin{equation*}
       G\times G/H\to G/H,\quad(g,C)\mapsto gC
       \end{equation*}
       The action is faithful if, for example, \(H\neq G\) and \(G\) is simple
    4. Every group \(G\) acts on itself by conjugation. For any \(N\lhd G\), \(G\) acts on \(N\)
       and \(G/N\) by conjugation
    #+END_examplle

    A *right action* \(X\times G\to X\) is defined similarly. To turn a right action into a left action,
    set \(g*x=xg^{-1}\). For example, there is a natural right action of \(G\) on the set of right
    cosets of a subgroup \(H\) in \(G\), namely \((C,g)\mapsto Cg\), which can be turned into a left
    action \((g,C)\mapsto Cg^{-1}\)

    A *map of \(G\)-sets* (*\(G\)-map*, *\(G\)-equivariant map*) is a map \(\varphi:X\to Y\) s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    \varphi(gx)=g\varphi(x),\quad\text{all }g\in G,\quad x\in X
    \end{equation*}

*** Orbits
    Let \(G\) act on \(X\). A subset \(S\subset X\) is *stable* under the action of \(G\) if
    \begin{equation*}
    g\in G,x\in S\Rightarrow gx\in S
    \end{equation*}
    The action of \(G\) on \(X\) then induces an action of \(G\) on \(S\)

    Write \(x\sim_Gy\) if \(y=gx\) for some \(g\in G\). This is an equivalence relation. The equivalence
    classes are called *\(G\)-orbits*. Thus the \(G\)-orbits partition \(X\). Write \(G\backslash X\)
    for the set of orbits

    By definition, the \(G\)-orbit containing \(x_0\) is
    \begin{equation*}
    Gx_0=\{gx_0\mid g\in G\}
    \end{equation*}
    It is the smallest \(G\)-stable subset of \(X\) containing \(x_0\)

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_examplle
    1. Suppose \(G\) acts on \(X\), and let \(\alpha\in G\) be an element of order \(n\). Then the orbits
       of \(\la\alpha\ra\) are the set of the form
       \begin{equation*}
       \{x_0,\alpha x_0,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}x_0\}
       \end{equation*}
    2. The orbits for a subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) acting on \(G\) by left multiplication are the right
       cosets of \(H\) in \(G\). We write \(H\backslash G\) for the set of right cosets. Note that
       the group law on \(G\) will *not* induce a group law on \(G/H\) unless \(H\) is normal
    3. For a group \(G\) acting on itself by conjugation, the orbits are called *conjugacy classes*:
       for \(x\in G\), the conjugacy class of \(x\) is the set
       \begin{equation*}
       \{gxg^{-1}\mid g\in G\}
       \end{equation*}
       of conjugates of \(x\).
    #+END_examplle

    A subset of \(X\) is stable iff it is a union of orbits. For example, a subgroup \(H\) of \(G\)
    is normal iff it is a union of conjugacy classes

    The action of \(G\) on \(X\) is said to be *transitive*, and \(G\) is said to act *transitively*
    on \(X\) if there is only one orbit. The set \(X\) is called a *homogeneous* \(G\)-set. For
    example, \(S_n\) acts transitively on \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\). For any subgroup \(H\) of a
    group \(G\), \(G\) acts transitively on \(G/H\), but the action of \(G\) on itself is never
    transitive if \(G\neq 1\) because \(\{1\}\) is always a conjugacy class

    The action of \(G\) on \(X\) is *doubly transitive* if for any two pairs \((x_1,x_2)\), \((y_1,y_2)\)
    of elements of \(X\) with \(x_1\neq x_2\) and \(y_1\neq y_2\), there exists a (single) \(g\in G\)
    s.t. \(gx_1=y_1\) and \(gx_2=y_2\). Define *\(k\)-fold transitivity* for \(k\ge 3\) similarly

*** Stabilizers
    Let \(G\) acts on \(X\). The *stabilizer* (or *isotropy group*) of an element \(x\in X\) is
    \begin{equation*}
    \Stab(x)=\{g\in G\mid gx=x\}
    \end{equation*}
    It is a subgroup, but it need not be a normal subgroup. The action is *free* if \(\Stab(x)=\{e\}\)
    for all \(x\)

       This group is called the *centralizer* \(C_G(x)\) of \(x\) in \(G\). It consists of all
       elements of \(G\) that commute with, i.e., centralize, \(x\). The intersection
       \begin{equation*}
       \bigcap_{x\in G}C_G(x)=\{g\in G\mid gx=xg\text{ for all }x\in G\}

    Then \(\Stab(S)\) is a subgroup of \(G\), and the same argument as in the proof of ref:4.4

    As \(H\) is normal, \(srs^{-1}=r^i\), some \(i\).
    Because \(s^2=1\), \(r=s^2rs^{-2}=s(srs^{-1})s^{-1}=r^{i^2}\) and so \(i^2\equiv 1\mod p\).

    Induction on \(n\). The center of \(G\) contains an element of order \(p\), and so \(N=\la g\ra\) is
    a normal subgroup of \(G\) of order \(p\). Now the induction hypothesis allows us to assume the

    We know that the center \(Z\) is nontrivial, and that \(G/Z\) is therefore has order 1 or \(p\).

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Let \(a\) be an element of \(G\) whose image in \(G/H\) generates it. Then every element
    of \(G\) can be written \(g=a^ih\) with \(h\in H\), \(i\in\Z\). Now

    The above proof shows that if \(H\subset Z(G)\) and \(G\) contains a set of representatives

    Let \(G\) be a noncommutative group of order 8. Then \(G\) must contain an element \(a\) of order 4
    (ref:ex1.6). If \(G\) contains an element \(b\) of order 2 not in \(\la a\ra\),
    then \(G\simeq\la a\ra\rtimes_\theta\la b\ra\) where \theta is the unique isomorphism \(\Z/2\Z\to(\Z/4\Z)^\times\), and so \(G\approx D_4\). If
    not, any element \(b\) of \(G\) not in \(\la a\ra\) must have order 4, and \(a^2=b^2\).
    Now \(bab^{-1}\) is an element of order 4 in \(\la a\ra\). It can't equal \(a\), because
    otherwise \(G\) would be commutative, and so \(bab^{-1}=a^3\). Therefore \(G\) is the quaternion group

*** Permutation groups
    Consider a permutation
    \begin{equation*}
    \sigma=
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1&2&3&\dots&n\\
    \sigma(1)&\sigma(2)&\sigma(3)&\dots&\sigma(n)
    \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    The ordered pairs \((i,j)\) with \(i<j\) and \(\sigma(i)>\sigma(j)\) are called the *inversions* of \sigma, and
    \sigma is said to be *even* or *odd* according as the number of inversions is even or odd. The
    *signature*, \(\sgn(\sigma)\) of \sigma is 1 or \(-1\) according as \sigma is even or odd.

    #+BEGIN_remark
    To compute the signature of \sigma, connect each element \(i\) in the top row to the element \(i\) in
    the bottom row, and count the number of times that the lines cross. For example,
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .4\textwidth
    #+NAME:
    #+CAPTION:

    is even
    #+END_remark

    For a permutation \sigma, consider the products
    \begin{align*}
    V=\prod_{1\le i<j\le n}(j-i)=(2-1)(3-1)\dots(n-1)&\\
    (3-2)\dots(n-2)&\\
    \dots\quad&\\
    (n-(n-1))&
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
    \sigma V=\prod_{1\le i<j\le n}(\sigma(j)-\sigma(i))=(\sigma(2)-\sigma(1))(\sigma(3)-\sigma(1))\dots(\sigma(n)-\sigma(1))&\\
    (\sigma(3)-\sigma(2))\dots(\sigma(n)-\sigma(2))&\\
    \dots\quad&\\
    (\sigma(n)-\sigma(n-1))&
    \end{align*}
    Both products run over the 2-element subsets \(\{i,j\}\) of \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\) and the terms
    corresponding to a subset are the same except that each inversion introduces a negative sign.
    Therefore
    \begin{equation*}
    \sigma V=\sgn(\sigma)V
    \end{equation*}

    Now let \(P\) be the additive group of maps \(\Z^n\to\Z\). For \(f\in P\) and \(\sigma\in S_n\), let \(\sigma f\)
    denote the element of \(P\) defined by
    \begin{equation*}
    (\sigma f)(z_1,\dots,z_n)=f(z_{\sigma(1)},\dots,z_{\sigma(n)})
    \end{equation*}
    For \(z\in\Z^n\) and \(\sigma\in S_n\), let \(z^\sigma\) denote the element of \(\Z^n\) s.t. \((z^\sigma)_i=z_{\sigma(i)}\).
    Then \((z^\sigma)^\tau=z^{\sigma\tau}\). By definition, \((\sigma f)(z)=f(z^\sigma)\), and
    so \(((\sigma\tau)f)(z)=f(z^{\sigma\tau})=f((z^\sigma)^\tau)=(\tau f)(z^\sigma)=(\sigma(\tau f))(z)\), i.e.
    \begin{equation*}
    \sigma(\tau f)=(\sigma\tau)f
    \end{equation*}

    Let \(p\in P\) defined by
    \begin{equation*}
    p(z_1,\dots,z_n)=\prod_{1\le i<j\le n}(z_j-z_i)
    \end{equation*}
    The same argument as above shows that
    \begin{equation*}
    \sigma p=\sgn(\sigma)p
    \end{equation*}
    On putting \(f=p\), we finds that
    \begin{equation*}
    \sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\tau)=\sgn(\sigma\tau)
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore

    When \(n\ge 2\), it is surjective, and so its
    kernel is a normal subgroup of \(S_n\) of order \(\frac{n!}{2}\), called the *alternating
    group* \(A_n\), i.e., \(A_n\) is the normal subgroup of \(S_n\) with positive sign

    #+BEGIN_remark
    We show shown that there exists a homomorhism \(\sgn:S_n\to\{\pm 1\}\) s.t. \(\sgn(\sigma)=-1\) for every
    transposition. The transposition generate \(S_n\), and so sign is uniquely determined by this
    property. Now let \(G=\Sym(X)\), where \(X\) is a set with \(n\) elements. The choice of an
    ordering of \(X\) determines an isomorphism of \(G\) with \(S_n\) sending transpositions to
    transpositions. Therefore \(G\) also admits a unique isomorphism \(\epsilon:G\to\{\pm 1\}\) s.t. \(\epsilon(\sigma)=-1\)
    for every transposition \sigma. Once we have chosen an ordering of \(X\), we can speak of the
    inversions of an element \sigma of \(G\), and define a sign homomorhism \(G\to\{\pm 1\}\) as before. This
    must agree with \epsilon, and so \(\epsilon(\sigma)\) equals 1 or \(-1\) according as \sigma has an even or an odd
    number of inversions.

    A *cycle* is a permutation of the following form
    \begin{equation*}
    i_1\mapsto i_2\mapsto i_3\mapsto\dots\mapsto i_r\mapsto i_1

    The \(i_j\) are required to be distinct. We denote this cycle by \((i_1 i_2\dots i_r)\) and call \(r\)
    its *length*. The *support of the cycle* \((i_1\dots i_r)\) is the set \(\{i_1,\dots,i_r\}\) and cycles are
    *disjoint* if their supports are disjoint. Disjoint cycles commute

    \begin{equation*}
    O=\{i,\sigma(i),\dots,\sigma^{r-1}(i)\}

    Therefore \sigma and the cycle \((i\;\sigma(i)\dots\sigma^{r-1}(i))\) have the same action on any element of \(O\).
    Let

[fn:1] Here is a direct proof that the theorem holds for an abelian group \(Z\) . We use inducftion
on the order of \(Z\). It suffices to show that \(Z\) contains an element whose order is divisible
by \(p\). Let \(g\neq 1\) be an element of \(Z\). If \(p\) doesn't divide the order of \(g\), then it
divides the order of \(Z/\la g\ra\), in which case there exists an element of \(G\) whose order
in \(Z/\la g\ra\) is divisible by \(p\). But the order of such  an element must itself be divisible by \(p\)
