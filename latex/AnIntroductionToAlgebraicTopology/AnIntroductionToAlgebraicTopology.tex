\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc3fa376}

\subsection{Notation}
\label{sec:orgad89c7b}
\(\bI=[0,1]\).
\begin{equation*}
S^n=\{x\in\R^{n+1}\mid\norm{x}=1\}
\end{equation*}
\(S^n\) is called the \textbf{\(n\)-sphere}. \(S^n\subset\R^{n+1}\) (\(S^1\) is the circle); 0-sphere \(S^0\)
consists of the two points \(\{-1,1\}\) and hence is a discrete two-point space. We may
regard \(S^n\) as the \textbf{equator} of \(S^{n+1}\)
\begin{equation*}
S^n=\R^{n+1}\cap S^{n+1}=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+2})\in S^{n+1}:x_{n+2}=0\}
\end{equation*}
The \textbf{north pole} is \((0,0,\dots,0,1)\in S^n\); the \textbf{south pole} is \((0,0,\dots,0,-1)\). The \textbf{antipode}
of \(x=(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in S^n\) is the other endpoint of the diameter having one endpoint \(x\); thus
the antipode of \(x\) is \(-x=(-x_1,\dots,-x_{n+1})\), for the distance from \(-x\) to \(x\) is 2.
\begin{equation*}
D^n=\{x\in\R^n\mid\norm{x}\le 1\}
\end{equation*}
\(D^n\) is called the \textbf{\(n\)-disk} (or \textbf{\(n\)-ball}).  Observe that \(S^{n-1}\subset D^n\subset \R^n\);
indeed \(S^{n-1}\) is the boundary of \(D^n\) in \(\R^n\)
\begin{equation*}
\Delta^n=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in\R^{n+1}:\text{ each }x_i\ge 0\text{ and }\sum x_i=1\}
\end{equation*}
\(\Delta^n\) is called the \textbf{standard \(n\)-simplex}. \(\Delta^0\) is a point, \(\Delta^1\) is a closed
interval, \(\Delta^2\) is a triangle (with interior), \(\Delta^3\) is a (solid) tetrahedron, and so on.

There is a standard homeomorphism from \(S^n\) - \{north pole\} to \(\R^n\), called \textbf{stereographic
projection}. Denote the north pole by \(N\), and define \(\sigma:S^n-\{N\}\to\R^n\) to be the intersection
of \(\R^n\) and the line joining \(x\) and \(N\). Points on the latter line have the
form \(tx+(1-t)N\), hence they have coordinates
\((tx_1,\dots,tx_n,tx_{n+1}+(1-t))\). The last coordinate is zero for \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\); hence
\begin{equation*}
\sigma(x)=(tx_1,\dots,tx_n)
\end{equation*}
where \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\). It is now routine to check that \(\sigma\) is indeed a homeomorphism. Note
that \(\sigma(x)=x\) iff \(x\) lies on the equator \(S^{n-1}\)

\subsection{Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem}
\label{sec:org3ea279d}
\begin{theorem}[]
Every continuous \(f:D^1\to D^1\) has a fixed point
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(f(-1)=a\) and \(f(1)=b\).If either \(f(-1)=-1\) or \(f(1)=1\), we are done. Therefore we
may assume that \(f(-1)=a>-1\) and that \(f(1)=b<1\) as drawn.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../images/AnIntroductionToAlgebraicTopology/1.png}
\label{}
\end{figure}
If \(G\) is the graph of \(f\) and \(\Delta\) is the graph of the identity function, then we must prove
that \(G\cap\Delta\neq\emptyset\). The idea is to use a connectness argument to show that every path in \(D^1\times D^1\)
from \(a\) to \(b\) must cross \(\Delta\).

Since \(f\) is continuous, \(G=\{(x,f(x)):x\in D^1\}\) is connected (continuous image of connected
space is connected). Define \(A=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)>x\}\)  and \(B=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)<x\}\). Note
that \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\), so that \(A\neq\emptyset\) and \(B\neq\emptyset\). If \(G\cap\Delta=\emptyset\), then \(G\) is the disjoint
union of \(A\) and \(B\).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
A subspace \(X\) of a topological space \(Y\) is a \textbf{retract} of \(Y\) if there is a continuous
map  \(r:Y\to X\) with \(r(x)=x\) for all \(x\in X\); such a map \(r\) is called a \textbf{retraction}
\end{definition}



\begin{theorem}[Brouwer fixed point theorem]
If \(f:D^n\to D^n\) is continuous, then there exists \(x\in D^n\) with \(f(x)=x\)
\end{theorem}

\section{Categories and Functors}
\label{sec:org7a95b4d}
\begin{definition}[]
A category \(\calc\) consists of three ingredients: a class of \textbf{objects}, \(\obj\calc\); sets of
\textbf{morphisms} \(\Hom(A,B)\), one for every ordered pair \(A,B\in\obj\calc\);
\textbf{composition} \(\Hom(A,B)\times\Hom(B,C)\to\Hom(A,C)\), denoted by \((f,g)\to g\circ f\), for
every \(A,B,C\in\obj\calc\) satisfying the following axioms
\begin{enumerate}
\item the family of \(\Hom(A,B)\)'s is pairwise disjoint
\item composition is associative when defined
\item for each \(A\in\obj\calc\) there exists an identity \(1_A\in\Hom(A,A)\) satisfying \(1_A\circ f=f\) for
every \(f\in\Hom(B,A)\), all \(B\in\obj\calc\) and \(g\circ 1_A=g\) for every \(g\in\Hom(A,C)\), all \(C\in\obj\calc\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\calc\) and \(\cala\) be categories with \(\obj\calc\subset\obj\cala\). If \(A,B\in\obj\calc\), let's denote the two
possible Hom sets by \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\) and \(\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\). Then \(\calc\) is a \textbf{subcategory}
of \(\cala\) if \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\subset\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\) for all \(A,B\in\obj\calc\) and if composition in \(\calc\) is
the same as composition in \(\cala\)
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
\(\calc=\Top^{2}\). here \(\obj\calc\) consists of all ordered pairs \((X,A)\) where \(X\) is a topological
space and \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\). A morphism \(f:(X,A)\to(Y,B)\) is an ordered
pair \((f,f')\) where \(f:X\to Y\) is continuous and \(fi=jf'\) (where \(i\) and \(j\) are
inclusions)
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
A\arrow[r,hookrightarrow,"i"]\arrow[d,"f'"']&X\arrow[d,"f"]\\
B\arrow[r,hookrightarrow,"j"']&Y
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
and composition is coordinatewise. \(\Top^2\) is called the category of \textbf{pairs} (of topological spaces)
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
\(\calc=\Top_*\). Here \(\obj\calc\) consists of all ordered pairs \((X,x_0)\) where \(X\) is a
topological space and \(x_0\) is a point of \(X\). \(\Top_*\) is a subcategory of \(\Top^2\) and
it is called the category of \textbf{pointed spaces}; \(x_0\) is called the \textbf{basepoint} of \((X,x_0)\) and
morphisms are called \textbf{pointed maps} (or \textbf{basepoint preserving maps}). The category \(\Sets_*\) of
pointed sets is defined similarly
\end{examplle}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.7}
Let \(f\in\Hom(A,B)\) be a morphism in a category \(\calc\). If \(f\) has a left inverse \(g\)
(\(g\in\Hom(B,A)\)$\backslash$ and \(g\circ f=1_A\)) and a right inverse \(h\) (\(h\in\Hom(B,A)\) and \(f\circ h=1_B\)),
then \(g=h\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.9}
A set \(X\) is called \textbf{quasi-ordered} (or \textbf{pre-ordered}) if \(X\) has a transitive and reflexive
relation \(\le\) (such a set is partially ordered if \(\le\) is antisymmetric). Prove that the
following construction gives a category \(\calc\). Define \(\obj\calc=X\), if \(x,y\in X\)
and \(x\not\le y\), define \(\Hom(x,y)=\emptyset\); if \(x\le y\), define \(\Hom(x,y)\) to be a set with
exactly one element, denoted by \(i_y^x\); if \(x\le y\le z\) define composition by \(i_z^y\circ i_y^x=i_z^x\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.10}
Let \(G\) be a \textbf{monoid}, that is, a semigroup with 1. Show that the following gives a
category \(\calc\). Let \(\obj\calc\) have exactly one element, denoted by *​; define \(\Hom(*,*)=G\) and
define composition \(G\times G\to G\) as the given multiplication in \(G\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}[]
A \textbf{diagram} in a category \(\calc\) is a directed graph whose vertices are labeled by objects of \(\calc\) and
whose directed edges are labeled by morphisms in \(\calc\). A \textbf{commutative diagram} in \(\calc\) is a diagram in
which, for each pair of vertices, every two paths (composites) between them are equal as
morphisms.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.12}
Given a category \(\calc\), shows that the following construction gives a category \(\calm\). First, an
object of \(\calm\) is a morphism of \(\calc\). Next, if \(f,g\in\obj\calm\), say \(f:A\to B\) and \(g:C\to D\),
then a morphism in \(\calm\) is an ordered pair \((h,k)\) of morphisms in \(\calc\) s.t. the diagram
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
A\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[d,"h"']&B\arrow[d,"k"]\\
C\arrow[r,"g"']&D
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
commutes. Define composition coordinatewise
\begin{equation*}
(h',k')\circ(h,k)=(h'\circ h,k'\circ k)
\end{equation*}
\end{exercise}

\index{congruence}
\begin{definition}[]
A \textbf{congruence} on a category \(\calc\) is an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the
class \(\bigcup_{(A,B)}\Hom(A,B)\) of all morphisms in \(\calc\) s.t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f\in\Hom(A,B)\) and \(f\sim f'\) implies \(f'\in\Hom(A,B)\)
\item \(f\sim f'\), \(g\sim g'\) and the composite \(g\circ f\) exists imply that
\begin{equation*}
g\circ f\sim g'\circ f'
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm0.4}
Let \(\calc\) be a category with congruence \(\sim\) and let \([f]\) denote the equivalence class of a
morphism \(f\). Define \(\calc'\) as follows
\begin{align*}
\obj\calc'&=\obj\calc\\
\Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)&=\{[f]:f\in\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\}\\
[g]\circ[f]&=[g\circ f]
\end{align*}
Then \(\calc'\) is a category
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Property 1 in the definition of congruence shows that \(\sim\) partitions each set \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\)
and this implies that \(\Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)\) is a set; moreover, the family of these sets is pairwise
disjoint. Property 2 in the definition of congruence shows that composition in \(\calc'\) is
well. \(\calc'\) is associative and \([1_A]\) is the identity is not hard
\end{proof}

The category \(\calc'\) is called a \textbf{quotient category} of \(\calc\); one usually
denotes \(\Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)\) by \([A,B]\)

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.14}
Let \(G\) be a group and let \(\calc\) be the one-object category it
defines: \(\obj\calc=\{*\}\), \(\Hom( *, *)=G\) and composition is the group operation. If \(H\) is a
normal subgroup of \(G\), define \(x\sim y\) to mean \(xy^{-1}\in H\). Show that \(\sim\) is a congruence
on \(\calc\) and that \([*, *]=G/H\) in the corresponding quotient category
\end{exercise}

\index{functor}
\begin{definition}[]
If \(\cala\) and \(\calc\) are categories, a \textbf{functor} \(T:\cala\to\calc\) is a function, that is,
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(A\in\obj\cala\) implies \(TA\in\obj\calc\)
\item if \(f:A\to A'\) is a morphism in \(\cala\), then \(Tf:TA\to TA'\) is a morphism in \(\calc\)
\item if \(f,g\) are morphisms in \(\cala\) for which \(g\circ f\) is defined, then
\begin{equation*}
T(g\circ f)=(Tg)\circ (Tf)
\end{equation*}
\item \(T(1_A)=1_{TA}\) for every \(A\in\obj\cala\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
If \(\calc\) is a category, the \textbf{identity functor} \(J:\calc\to\calc\) is defined by \(JA=A\) for every
object \(A\) and \(Jf=f\) for every morphism
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
If \(M\) is a fixed topological space, Then \(T_m:\Top\to\Top\) is a functor,
where \(T_M(X)=X\times M\) and if \(f:X\to Y\) is continuous, then \(T_M(f):X\times M\to Y\times M\) is defined by
\((x,m)\mapsto(f(x),m)\)
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
Fix an object \(A\) in category \(\calc\). Then \(\Hom(A,-):\calc\to\Sets\) is a functor assigning to each
object \(B\) the set \(\Hom(A,B)\) and to each morphism \(f:B\to B'\) the \textbf{induced
map} \(\Hom(A,f):\Hom(A,B)\to\Hom(A,B')\) defined by \(g\mapsto f\circ g\). One usually denotes the induced
map \(\Hom(A,f)\) by \(f_*\)
\end{examplle}

Functors as just defined are also called \textbf{covariant functors} to distinguish them from
\textbf{contravariant functors} that reverse the direction of arrows. Thus the functor of the example  is
sometimes called a \textbf{covariant Hom functor}.

\begin{definition}[]
if \(\cala\) and \(\calc\) are categories, a \textbf{contravariant functor} \(S:\cala\to\calc\) is a function that
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(A\in\obj\cala\) implies \(SA\in\obj\calc\)
\item if \(f:A\to A'\) is a morphism in \(\calc\), then \(Sf:SA'\to SA\) is a morphism in \(\calc\)
\item if \(f,g\) are morphisms in \(\cala\) for which \(g\circ f\) is defined, then
\begin{equation*}
S(g\circ f)=S(f)\circ S(g)
\end{equation*}
\item \(S(1_A)=1_{SA}\) for every \(A\in\obj\cala\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
Fix an object \(B\) in a category \(\calc\). Then \(\Hom(-,B):\calc\to\Sets\) is a contravariant functor
assigning to each object \(A\) the set \(\Hom(A,B)\) and to each morphism \(g:A\to A'\) the
\textbf{induced map} \(\Hom(g,B):\Hom(A',B)\to\Hom(A,B)\) defined by \(h\mapsto h\circ g\). One usually denotes the
induced map \(\Hom(g,B)\) by \(g^*\); \(\Hom(-,B)\) is called a \textbf{contravariant Hom functor}
\end{examplle}

\begin{definition}[]
An \textbf{equivalence} in a category \(\calc\) is a morphism \(f:A\to B\) for which there exists a
morphism \(g:B\to A\) with \(f\circ g=1_B\) and \(g\circ f=1_A\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(\cala\) and \(\calc\) are categories and \(T:\cala\to\calc\) is a functor of either variance, then \(f\) an
equivalence in \(\cala\) implies that \(Tf\) is an equivalence in \(\calc\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.17}
Let \(\calc\) and \(\cala\) be categories, let \(\sim\) be a congruence on \(\calc\). If \(T:\calc\to\cala\) is a functor
with \(T(f)=T(g)\) whenever \(f\sim g\), then \(T\) defines a functor \(T':\calc'\to\cala\) (where \(\calc'\) is
the quotient category) by \(T'(X)=T(X)\) for every object \(X\) and \(T'([f])=T(f)\) for every
morphism \(f\).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex0.20}
\begin{enumerate}
\item if \(X\) is a topological space,  show that \(C(X)\), the set of all continuous real-valued
functions on \(X\), is a commutative ring with 1 under pointwise operations
\begin{equation*}
f+g:x\mapsto f(x)+g(x)\quad\text{ and }\quad f\cdot g\mapsto f(x)g(x)
\end{equation*}
for all \(x\in X\)
\item show that \(X\mapsto C(X)\) gives a (contravariant) functor \(\Top\to\Rings\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item From exercise \ref{ex0.12}

\section{Some Basic Topological Notions}
\label{sec:orgfd059f5}

\subsection{Homotopy}
\label{sec:org08ab4ed}
\index{homotopy}
\begin{definition}[]
If \(X\) and \(Y\) are spaces and if \(f_0,f_1\) are continuous maps from \(X\) to \(Y\),
then \(f_0\) is \textbf{homotopic} to \(f_1\), denoted by \(f_0\simeq f_1\) if there is a continuous
map \(F:X\times\bI\to Y\) with
\begin{equation*}
F(x,0)=f_0(x) \quad\text{ and }\quad F(x,1)=f_1(x) \quad\text{for all }x\in X
\end{equation*}
Such a map \(F\) is called a \textbf{homotopy}, written as \(F:f_0\simeq f_1\)
\end{definition}

If \(f_t:X\to Y\) is defined by \(f_t(x)=F(x,t)\), then a homotopy \(F\) gives a one-parameter
family of continuous maps deforming \(f_0\) into \(f_1\)

\begin{lemma}[Gluing lemma]
Assume that a space \(X\) is a finite union of closed subsets \(X=\bigcup_{i=1}^nX_i\). If, for some
space \(Y\), there are continuous maps \(f_i:X_i\to Y\) that agree on overlaps
(\(f_i|X_i\cap X_j=f_j|X_i\cap X_j\) for all \(i,j\)), then there exists a unique continuous \(f:X\to Y\)
with \(f|X_i=f_i\) for all \(i\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(C\) is closed in \(Y\), then
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}(C)&=X\cap f^{-1}(C)=(\bigcup X_i)\cap f^{-1}(C)\\
&=\bigcup (X_i\cap f^{-1}(C))\\
&=\bigcup (X_i\cap f_i^{-1}(C))=\bigcup f_i^{-1}(C)
\end{align*}
Since each \(f_i\) is continuous, \(f_i^{-1}(C)\) is closed in \(X_i\). Since \(X_i\) is closed
in \(X\), \(f_i^{-1}(C)\) is closed in \(X\), therefore \(f^{-1}(C)\) is closed in \(X\) and \(f\)
is continuous
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Gluing Lemma]
Assume that a space \(X\) has a (possibly infinite) open cover \(X=\bigcup X_i\). If for some
space \(Y\), there are continuous maps \(f_i:X_i\to Y\) that agree on overlaps, then there exists a
unique continuous \(f:X\to Y\) with \(f|X_i=f_i\) for all \(i\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[]
Homotopy is an equivalence relation on the set of all continuous maps \(X\to Y\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\emph{Reflexivity}. If \(f:X\to Y\), define \(F:X\times\bI\to Y\) by \(F(x,t)=f(x)\) for all \(x\in X\) and \(t\in\bI\);
clearly \(F:f\simeq f\)

\emph{Symmetry}: Assume that \(f\simeq g\), so there is a continuous \(F:X\times\bI\to Y\) with \(F(x,0)=f(x)\)
and \(F(x,1)=g(x)\) for all \(x\in X\). Define \(G:X\times\bI\to Y\) by \(G(x,t)=F(x,1-t)\), and note
that \(G:g\simeq f\).

\emph{Transivity}: assume that \(F:f\simeq g\) and \(G:g\simeq h\). Define \(H:X\times\bI\to Y\) by
\begin{equation*}
H(x,t)=
\begin{cases}
F(x,2t)&0\le t\le 1/2\\
G(x,2t-1)&1/2\le t\le 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Because these functions agree on the overlap \(\{(x,1/2):x\in X\}\), the gluing lemma shows
that \(H\) is continuous. Therefore \(H:f\simeq h\)
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
If \(f:X\to Y\) is continuous, its \textbf{homotopy class} is the equivalence class
\begin{equation*}
[f]=\{\text{continuous }g:X\to Y:g\simeq f\}
\end{equation*}
The family of all such homotopy classes is denoted by \([X,Y]\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.3}
Let \(f_i:X\to Y\) and \(g_i:Y\to Z\), for \(i=0,1\), be continuous. If \(f_0\simeq f_1\) and \(g_0\simeq g_1\),
then \(g_0\circ f_0\simeq g_1\circ f_1\); that is, \([g_0\circ f_0]=[g_1\circ f_1]\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(F:f_0\simeq f_1\) and \(G:g_0\simeq g_1\) be homotopies. First, we show that
\begin{equation*}
g_0\circ f_0\simeq g_1\circ f_0
\end{equation*}
Define \(H:X\times\bI\to Z\) by \(H(x,t)=G(f_0(x),t)\). Clearly, \(H\) is continuous;
moreover, \(H(x,0)=G(f_0(x),0)=g_0(f_0(x))\) and \(H(x,1)=G(f_0(x),1)=g_1(f_0(x))\). Now observe
that
\begin{equation*}
K:g_1\circ f_0\sim g_1\circ f_1
\end{equation*}
where \(K:X\times\bI\to Z\) is the composite \(g_1\circ F\). Now use the transitivity of the homotopy relation,
we have \(g_0\circ f_0\simeq g_1\circ f_1\)
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
Homotopy is a congruence on the category \(\Top\).
\end{corollary}

It follows from Theorem \ref{thm0.4} that there is a quotient category whose objects are
topological spaces \(X\), whose Hom sets are \(\Hom(X,Y)=[X,Y]\) and whose composition
is \([g]\circ[f]=[g\circ f]\)

\begin{definition}[]
The quotient category just described is called the \textbf{homotopy category}, and it is denoted by
\(\hTop\)
\end{definition}

All the functors \(T:\Top\to\cala\) that we shall construct, where \(\cala\) is some ``algebraic'' category
(e.g. \(\Ab\), \(\Groups\), \(\Rings\)) will have the property that \(f\simeq g\)
implies \(T(f)=T(g)\). This fact, aside from a natural wish to identify homotopic maps, makes
homotopy valuable, \emph{beacause it guarantees that the algebraic problem in \(\cala\) arising from a}
\emph{topological problem via \(T\) is simpler than the original problem}

\index{homotopy type}
\begin{definition}[]
A continuous map \(f:X\to Y\) is a \textbf{homotopy equivalence} if there is a continuous map \(g:Y\to X\)
with \(g\circ f\simeq 1_X\) and \(f\circ g\simeq 1_Y\). Two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) have the \textbf{same homotopy type} if
there is a homotopy equivalence \(f:X\to Y\)
\end{definition}

\(f\) is a homotopy equivalence iff \([f]\in[X,Y]\) is an equivalence in \(\hTop\). (\label{Problem1})

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be spaces, and let \(y_0\in Y\). The \textbf{constant map} at \(y_0\) is the
function \(c:X\to Y\) with \(c(x)=y_0\) for all \(x\in X\). A continuous map \(f:X\to Y\) is
\textbf{nullhomotopic} if there is a constant map \(c:X\to Y\) with \(f\simeq c\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.5}
Let \(\C\) denote the complex numbers, let \(\Sigma_\rho\subset\C\approx\R^2\) denote the circle with center at the origin
0 and radius \(\rho\), and let \(f_\rho^n:\Sigma_\rho\to\C-\{0\}\) denote the restriction to \(\Sigma^\rho\) of \(z\mapsto z^n\). If none
of the maps \(f_\rho^n\) is nullhomotopic (\(n\ge 1\) and \(\rho>0\)) then the fundamental theorem of
algebra is true (i.e., every nonconstant complex polynomial has a complex root)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider the polynomial with complex coefficients
\begin{equation*}
g(z)=z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\dots+a_1z+a_0
\end{equation*}
Choose \(\rho>\max\{1,\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\}\) and define \(F:\Sigma_\rho\times\bI\to\C\)
\begin{equation*}
F(z,t)=z^n+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)a_iz^i
\end{equation*}
It's obvious that \(F:g|\Sigma_\rho\simeq f_\rho^n\) if we can show that the image of \(F\) is contained
in \(\C-\{0\}\). that is, \(F(z,t)\neq0\). If, on the contrary, \(F(z,t)=0\)  for some \(t\in\bI\) and
some \(z\) with \(\abs{z}=\rho\), then \(z^n=-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)a_iz^i\). The triangle inequality gives
\begin{equation*}
\rho^n\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)\abs{a_i}\rho^i\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\rho^i\le\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\right)\rho^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
for \(\rho>1\) implies that \(\rho^i\le\rho^{n-1}\). Canceling \(\rho^{n-1}\) gives \(\rho\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\),
a contradiction.

Assume now that \(g\) has no complex roots. Define \(G:\Sigma_\rho\times\bI\to\C-\{0\}\) by
\(G(z,t)=g((1-t)z)\). (Since \(g\) has no roots, the values of \(G\) do lie in \(\C-\{0\}\))
Visibly, \(G:g|\Sigma_\rho\simeq k\), where \(k\) is the constant function at \(a_0\). Therefore \(g|\Sigma_\rho\) is
nullhomotopic and by transitivity, \(f_\rho^n\) is nullhomotopic, contradicting the hypothesis.
\end{proof}

A common problem involves extending a map \(f:X\to Z\) to a larger space \(Y\); the picture is
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
Y\arrow[dr,dashed,"g"]\\
X\arrow[u,hookrightarrow]\arrow[r,"f"']&Z
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
Homotopy itself raises such a problem: if \(f_0,f_1:X\to Z\) then \(f_0\simeq f_1\) if we can
extend \(f_0\cup f_1:X\times\{0\}\cup X\times\{1\}\to Z\) to all of \(X\times\bI\)

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.6}
Let \(f:S^n\to Y\) be a continuous map into some space \(Y\). TFAE
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f\) is nullhomotopic
\item \(f\) can be extended to a continuous map \(D^{n+1}\to Y\)
\item if \(x_0\in S^n\) and \(k:S^n\to Y\) is the constant map at \(f(x_0)\), then there is a
homotopy \(F:f\simeq k\) with \(F(x_0,t)=f(x_0)\) for all \(t\in\bI\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\(1\to 2\). Assume that \(F:f\simeq c\) , where \(c(x)=y_0\) for all \(x\in S^n\). Define \(g:D^{n+1}\to Y\)
by
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=
\begin{cases}
y_0&0\le\norm{x}\le 1/2\\
F(x/\norm{x},2-2\norm{x})&1/2\le\norm{x}\le 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
if \(x\neq 0\), then \(x/\norm{x}\in S^n\); if \(1/2\le\norm{x}\le 1\) then \(2-2\norm{x}\in\bI\);
if \(\norm{x}=1/2\) then \(2-2\norm{x}=1\) and \(F(x/\norm{x},1)=c(x/\norm{x})=y_0\). The gluing
lemma shows that \(g\) is continuous. Finally \(g\) does extend \(f\): if \(x\in S^n\),
then \(\norm{x}=1\) and \(g(x)=F(x,0)=f(x)\).

\(2\to 3\). Assume that \(g:D^{n+1}\to Y\) extends \(f\). Define \(F:S^n\times\bI\to Y\)
by \(F(x,t)=g((1-t)x+tx_0)\); note that \((1-t)x+tx_0\in D^{n+1}\). Visibly \(F\) is continuous.
Now \(F(x,0)=g(x)=f(x)\) while \(F(x,1)=g(x_0)=f(x_0)\) for all \(x\in S^n\); hence \(F:f\simeq k\)
where \(k:S^n\to Y\) is the constant map at \(f(x_0)\). Finally, \(F(x_0,t)=g(x_0)=f(x_0)\) for
all \(t\in\bI\)

\(3\to 1\) obvious
\end{proof}

\subsection{Convexity, Contractibility, and Cones}
\label{sec:org4479158}
\begin{definition}[]
A subset \(X\) of \(\R^m\) is \textbf{convex} if for each pair of points \(x,y\in X\) the line segment
joining \(x\) and \(y\) is contained in \(X\). In other words, if \(x,y\in X\),
then \(tx+(1-t)y\in X\) for all \(t\in\bI\)
\end{definition}

\index{contractible}
\begin{definition}[]
A space \(X\) is \textbf{contractible} if \(1_X\) is nullhomotopic
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.7}
Every convex set \(X\) is contractible
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Choose \(x_0\in X\), and define \(c:X\to X\) by \(c(x)=x_0\) for all \(x\in X\). Define \(F:X\times\bI\to X\)
by \(F(x,t)=tx_0+(1-t)x\). Hence \(F:1_X\simeq c\).
\end{proof}

A hemisphere is contractible but not convex, so that the converse of Theorem \ref{thm1.7} is not
true

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.3}
Let \(R:S^1\to S^1\) be rotation by \(\alpha\) radians. Prove that \(R\simeq 1_S\). Conclude that every continuous
map \(f:S^1\to S^1\) is homotopic to a continuous map \(g:S^1\to S^1\) with \(g(1)=1\)
(where \(1=e^{2\pi i0}\in S^1\))
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Let \(F:S^1\times\bI\to S^1\) be
\begin{equation*}
F((\cos\theta,\sin\theta),t)=(\cos(\theta+\alpha(1-t)),\sin(\theta+\alpha(1-t)))

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.5}
\label{Problem2}
Let \(X=\{0\}\cup\{1,1/2,1/3,\dots,1/n,\dots\}\) and let \(Y\) be a countable discrete space. Show that \(X\)
and \(Y\) do not have the same homotopy type.
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(X\) be a topological space and let \(X'=\{X_j:j\in J\}\) be a partition of \(X\). The \textbf{natural
map} \(\nu:X\to X'\) is defined by \(\nu(x)=X_j\) where \(x\in X_j\). The \textbf{quotient topology} on \(X'\) is
the family of all subsets \(U'\) of \(X'\) for which \(\nu^{-1}(U')\) is open in \(X\)
\end{definition}

\(\nu:X\to X'\) is continuous when \(X'\) has the quotient topology. There are two special cases that
we wish to mention. If \(A\) is a subset of \(X\), then we write \(X/A\) for \(X'\), where the
partition of \(X\) consists of \(A\) together with all the one-point subsets of \(X-A\). The
second special case arises from an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(X\).  In this case, the
partition consists of the equivalence classes, the natural map is given by \(\nu:x\mapsto[x]\), and the
quotient space is denoted by \(X/\sim\).

\begin{examplle}[]
Let \(X=\bI\times\bI\)
\begin{figure}[htbp]

and define \((x,0)\sim(x,1)\) for every \(x\in\bI\). Then \(X/\sim\) is homeomorphic to the
cylinder \(S^1\times\bI\). Furthermore, suppose we define a second equivalence relation on \(\bI\times\bI\)
by \((x,0)\sim(x,1)\) for all \(x\in\bI\) and \((0,y)\sim(1,y)\) for all \(y\in\bI\). Then \(\bI\times\bI/\sim\) is the
\textbf{torus} \(S^1\times S^1\)
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
\label{example1.3}
If \(h:X\to Y\) is a function, then \(\textbf{ker \textit{h}}\) is the equivalence relation on \(X\) defined
by \(x\sim x'\) if \(h(x)=h(x')\). The corresponding quotient space is denoted by \(X/\ker h\). Note
that, given \(h:X\to Y\) there always exists an injection \(\varphi:X/\ker h\to Y\) making the diagram
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
X\ar[rr,"h"]\ar[dr,"\nu"']&&Y\\
&X/\ker h\ar[ur,"\varphi"']
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
namely, \(\varphi([x])=h(x)\)
\end{examplle}

\begin{definition}[]
A continuous surjection \(f:X\to Y\) is an \textbf{identification} if a subset \(U\) of \(Y\) is open
iff \(f^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(X\)
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
If \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation on \(X\)and \(X/\sim\) is given the quotient topology, then the
natural map \(\nu:X\to X/\sim\) is an identification
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
If \(f:X\to Y\) is a continuous surjective map having a \textbf{section} (i.e., there is a continuous \(s:Y\to X\)
with \(fs=1_Y\)), then \(f\) is an identification
\end{examplle}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.8}
Let \(f:X\to Y\) be a continuous surjection. Then \(f\) is an identification iff for all
spaces \(Z\) and all functions \(g:Y\to Z\), one has \(g\) continuous iff \(gf\) is continuous
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
X\ar[rr,"gf"]\ar[dr,"f"']&&Z\\
&Y\ar[ur,"g"']
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume \(f\) is an identification. If \(g\) is continuous, then \(gf\) is continuous. Conversely,
if \(f\) is continuous and let \(V\)  be open in \(Z\). Then \(f^{-1}g^{-1}(V)\) is open
in \(X\); since \(f\) is an identification, \(g^{-1}(V)\) is open in \(Y\)

Assume the condition. Let \(Z/\ker f\), let \(\nu:X\to X/\ker f\) be the natural map and
let \(\varphi:X/\ker f\to Y\) be the injection of Example \ref{example1.3}. Note that \(\varphi\) is surjective
because \(f\) is. Consider the commutative diagram
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd} [column sep=small]
X\ar[rr,"\nu"]\ar[rd,"f"']&&X/\ker f\\
&Y\ar[ur,"\varphi^{-1}"']
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
Then \(\varphi^{-1}f=\nu\) is continuous implies that \(\varphi^{-1}\) is continuous, by hypothesis. Also
\(\varphi\) is continuous because \(\nu\) is an identification. We conclude that \(\varphi\) is a homeomorphism
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(f:X\to Y\) be a function and let \(y\in Y\). Then \(f^{-1}(y)\) is called the \textbf{fiber} over \(y\)
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}[]
\label{cor1.9}
Let \(f:X\to Y\) be an identification and, for some space \(Z\), let \(h:X\to Z\) be a continuous
function that is constant on each fiber of \(f\). Then \(hf^{-1}:Y\to Z\) is continuous
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
X\ar[rr,"h"]\ar[dr,"f"']&&Z\\
&Y\ar[ur,"hf^{-1}"']
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
Moreover, \(hf^{-1}\) is an open (closed) map iff \(h(U)\) is open (closed) in \(Z\)
whenever \(U\) is an open (closed ) set in \(X\) of the form \(U=f^{-1}f(U)\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\(h\) is constant on each fiber of \(f\) implies that \(hf^{-1}\) is well-defined. \(hf^{-1}\) is
continuous because \((hf^{-1})(f)=h\) is continuous, and Theorem \ref{thm1.8} applies. Finally
if \(V\) is open in \(Y\), then \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open set of the stated form \(f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}f(f^{-1}(V))\)
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
Let \(X\) and \(Z\) be spaces and let \(h:X\to Z\) be an identification. Then the
map \(\varphi:X/\ker h\to Z\) defined by \([x]\mapsto h(x)\) is a homeomorphism
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
\(\varphi\) is a bijection. \(\varphi\) is continuous by Corollary \ref{cor1.9}. The \(\nu:X\to X/\ker h\) be the natural
map. Let \(U\) open in \(X/\ker h\). Then \(h^{-1}\varphi(U)=\nu^{-1}(U)\) is an open set in \(X\),
because \(\nu\) is continuous and hence \(\varphi(U)\) is open, because \(h\) is an identification

Weird
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.10}
Let \(f:X\to Y\) be an identification and let \(g:Y\to Z\) be a continuous surjection. Then \(g\) is
an identification iff \(gf\) is an identification

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.11}
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be spaces with equivalence relations \(\sim\) and \(\Box\), respectively, and
let \(f:X\to Y\) be a continuous map preserving the relations (if \(x\sim x'\) then \(f(x)\Box f'(x)\)).
Prove that the induced map \(\barf:X/\sim\to Y/\Box\) is continuous; moreover, if \(f\) is an
identification then so is \(\barf\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Consider
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
X\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,"\nu_1"']&Y\ar[d,"\nu_2"]\\
X/\sim\ar[r,"\barf"']&Y/\Box

Visibly, the diagram commutes

\begin{definition}[]
If \(X\) is a space, define an equivalence relation on \(X\times\bI\) by \((x,t)\sim(x',t')\)
if \(t=t'=1\). Denote the equivalence class of \((x,t)\) by \([x,t]\). The \textbf{cone} over \(X\),
denoted by \(CX\), is the equivalence space \(X\times\bI/\sim\)
\end{definition}

One may regard \(CX\) as the quotient space \(X\times\bI/X\times\{1\}\). The identified point \([x,1]\) is
called the \textbf{vertex}

\begin{examplle}[]
For spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), every continuous map \(f:X\times\bI\to Y\) with \(f(x,1)=y_0\), say, for
all \(x\in X\), induces a continuous map \(\barf:CX\to Y\), namely, \(\barf:[x,t]\to f(x,t)\). In
particular, let \(f:S^n\times\bI\to D^{n+1}\) be the map \((u,t)\mapsto(1-t)u\); since \(f(u,1)=0\) for
all \(u\in S^n\), there is a continuous map \(\barf:CS^n\to D^{n+1}\) with \([u,t]\mapsto(1-t)u\).
Check: \(\barf\) is a homeomorphism.
\end{examplle}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.13}
For fixed \(t\) with \(0\le t<1\), prove that \(x\mapsto[x,t]\) defines a homeomorphism from a
space \(X\) to a subspace of \(CX\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}[]
For every space \(X\), the cone \(CX\) is contractible
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Define \(F:CX\times\bI\to CX\) by \(F([x,t],s)=[x,(1-s)t+s]\)
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[]
A space \(X\) has the same homotopy type as a point iff \(X\) is contractible
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(\{a\}\) be a one-point space, and assume that \(X\) and \(\{a\}\) have the same homotopy type.
There are thus maps \(f:X\to\{a\}\) and \(g:\{a\}\to X\) (with \(g(a)=x_0\in X\)) with \(g\circ f\simeq 1_X\)
and \(f\circ g\simeq 1_{\{a\}}\) (actually \(f\circ g=1_{\{a\}}\)). But \(gf(x)=g(a)=x_0\) for all \(x\in X\), so
that \(g\circ f\) is constant. Therefore \(1_X\) is nullhomotopic and \(X\) is contractible

Assume that \(1_X\simeq k\) where \(k(x)\equiv x_0\in X\). Define \(f:X\to\{x_0\}\) as the constant map
at \(x_0\) and define \(g:\{x_0\}\to X\) by \(g(x_0)=x_0\). \(f\circ g=1_{\{x_0\}}\) and \(g\circ f=k\simeq 1_X\),
by hypothesis.
\end{proof}

This theorem suggests that contractible spaces may behave as singletons

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(Y\) is contractible, then any two maps \(X\to Y\) are homotopic (indeed they are nullhomotopic)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(1_Y\simeq k\), where there is \(y_0\in y\) with \(k(y)=y_0\) for all \(y\in Y\).
Define \(g:X\to Y\) as the constant map \(g(x)=y_0\) for all \(x\in X\). If \(f:X\to Y\) is any
continuous map, we claim that \(f\simeq g\). Consider the diagram
\begin{center}\begin{tikzcd}
X\ar[r]&Y\ar[r,yshift=2pt,"k"]\ar[r,yshift=-2pt,"1_Y"']&Y
\end{tikzcd}\end{center}
Since \(1_Y\simeq k\), Theorem \ref{thm1.3} gives \(f=1_Y\circ f\simeq k\circ f=g\)

Since homotopy relation is an equivalence, any two maps \(X\to Y\) are homotopic
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
A \textbf{path} in \(X\) is a continuous map \(f:\bI\to X\). if \(f(0)=a\) and \(f(1)=b\), one says that \(f\)

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
A space \(X\) is \textbf{path connected} if, for every \(a,b\in X\), there exists a path in \(X\) from \(a\)
to \(b\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.14}
If \(X\) is path connected, then \(X\) is connected
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose \(X=A\coprod B\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are nonempty open subsets of \(X\). Choose \(a\in A\)
and \(b\in B\) and let \(f:\bI\to X\) be a path from \(a\) to \(b\). Now \(f(\bI)\) is connected, yet
\begin{equation*}
f(\bI)=(A\cap f(\bI))\cup(B\cap f(\bI))
\end{equation*}
displays \(f(\bI)\) as disconnected, a contradiction
\end{proof}

The converse of Theorem \ref{thm1.14} is false

sequence in \(X\) with limit \((x,y)\in\R^2\). We must prove \((x,y)\in X\). If \(x=0\)
then \((x,y)=(0,y)\in X\). If \(x>1\), then upon dropping the first few terms of the sequence we
can assume \(x_n>0\) for all \(n\). Then \((x_n,y_n)\in G\). Since the function \(t\mapsto\sin(1/t)\)
on \((0,\infty)\) is continuous, from the condition \(x_n\to x\) we conclude
\begin{equation*}
y=\lim y_n=\lim\sin(1/x_n)=\sin(1/x)
\end{equation*}

Then as \(G\) is connected, \(\barG\) is connected
\end{examplle}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.15}
Show that the \(\sin(1/x)\) space \(X\) is not path connected
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(f:\bI\to X\) is a path from \((0,0)\to(1/2\pi,0)\). If \(t_0=\sup\{t\in\bI:f(t)\in A\}\),
then \(a=f(t_0)\in A\) and \(f(s)\not\in A\) for all \(s>t_0\). One may thus assume that there is a
path \(g:\bI\to X\) with \(g(0)\in A\) and with \(g(t)\in G\) for all \(t>0\).

From \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35054/topologists-sine-curve-is-not-path-connected}{StackExchange}.

If \(f=(f_1,f_2):[0,1]\to X\subseteq\R^2\).  is a path with \(f(0)=(0,0)\) ,then \(f(t)=(0,0)\) for all \(t\)

Suppose that \(f(t)\) is not always \((0,0)\). Removing an initial part of the interval and then
rescaling if necessary, assuming that \(0=\sup\{t:f([0,t]=\{(0,0)\})\}\). By continuity of \(f_2\),
there is a \(\delta>0\) s.t. \(\abs{f_2(t)}<1\) for all \(t<\delta\). Take \(0<t_0<\delta\) with \(f_1(t_0)>0\).
By continuity of \(f_1\) and the intermediate value theorem, \([0,f_1(t_0)]\) is in the image
of \(f_1\) restricted to \([0,t_0]\). Since \(f_2(t)=\sin(1/f_1(t))\) for all \(t\)
with \(f_1(t)\neq 0\). It follows that \([-1,1]\) is in the image of \(f_2\) restricted
to \([0,t_0]\), this contradicts \(t_0<\delta\).
\end{proof}

\label{ex1.19}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A space \(X\) is path connected iff every two constant maps \(X\to X\) are homotopic
\item If \(X\) is contractible and \(Y\) is path connected, then any two continuous maps \(X\to Y\)

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\Rightarrow\). Take two constants as initial point and end point.

X\ar[r,yshift=2pt,"1_X"]\ar[r,yshift=-2pt,"k"']&X\ar[r,"f"]&Y

Then \(f\circ 1_X\simeq f\circ k\), and \(f\circ k\) is homotopic to any constant map. So \(f\) is homotopic to
every constant map.

If \(F:f\simeq g\), where \(f,g:X\to Y\). If \(C\) is a path component of \(X\), then \(C\times\bI\) is path
connected (Exercise \ref{ex1.21}), hence \(F(C\times\bI)\) is path connected (Exercise \ref{ex1.22}). Now
\begin{equation*}
f(C)=F(C\times\{0\})\subset F(C\times\bI)

and
\begin{equation*}
g(C)=F(C\times\{1\})\subset F(C\times\bI)
\end{equation*}
the unique path component of \(Y\) containing \(F(C\times\bI)\) thus contains both \(f(C)\)
and \(g(C)\). This says that \(\pi_0(f)=\pi_0(g)\)
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
If \(X\) and \(Y\) have the same homotopy type, then they have the same number of path components
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(f:X\to Y\) and \(g:Y\to X\) are continuous with \(g\circ f\simeq 1_X\) and \(f\circ g\simeq 1_Y\). Then
\(\pi_0(g\circ f)=\pi_0(1_X)\) and \(\pi_0(f\circ g)=\pi_0(1_Y)\) by Theorem \ref{thm1.16}. Since \(\pi_0\) is a
functor, it follows that \(\pi_0(f)\) is a bijection
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}[]
A space \(X\) is \textbf{locally path connected} if, for each \(x\in X\) and every open neighborhood \(U\)
of \(x\), there is an open \(V\) with \(x\in V\subset U\) s.t. any two points in \(V\) can be joined by a
path in \(U\)
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
Let \(X\) be the subspace of \(\R^2\) obtained from the sin(1/x) space by adjoining a curve
from \(0,1\) to \((\frac{1}{2\pi},0)\). \(X\) is path connected but not locally path connected
\end{examplle}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm1.18}
A space \(X\) is locally path connected iff path components of open subsets are open. In
particular, if \(X\) is locally path connected, then its path components are open.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume that \(X\) is locally path connected and that \(U\) is an open subset of \(X\). Let \(C\)
be a path component of \(U\) and let \(x\in C\). There is an open \(V\) with \(x\in V\subset U\) s.t. every
point of \(V\) can be joined to \(x\) by a path in \(U\). Hence \(V\subset C\). Therefore \(C\) is
open (\(C=\bigcup V_x\)).

Conversely, let \(U\) be an open set in \(X\), let \(x\in U\) and let \(V\) be the path component
of \(x\) in \(U\). By hypothesis, \(V\) is open. Therefore \(X\) is locally path connected
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
\(X\) is locally path connected iff for each \(x\in X\) and each open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\)
,there is an open path connected \(V\) with \(x\in V\subset U\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[]
If \(X\) is locally path connected, then the components of every open set coincide with its path
components. In particular, the components of \(X\) coincide with the path components of \(X\)
\end{corollary}

guess in here, component means open set

\begin{proof}
Let \(C\) be a component of an open set \(U\) in \(X\), and let \(\{A_j:j\in J\}\) be the path
components of \(C\); then \(C\) is the disjoint union of \(A_j\); By Theorem \ref{thm1.18}
each \(A_j\) is open in \(C\), hence each \(A_j\) is closed in \(C\). Were there more than
one \(A_j\), then \(C\) would be disconnected
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
If \(X\) is connected and locally path connected, then \(X\) is path connected
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since \(X\) is connected, \(X\) has only one component; since \(X\) is locally path connected,
this component is a path component
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(A\) be a subspace of \(X\) and let \(i:A\hookrightarrow X\) be the inclusion. Then \(A\) is a
\textbf{deformation retract} of \(X\) if there is a continuous \(r:X\to A\) s.t. \(r\circ i=1_A\)
and \(i\circ r\simeq 1_X\)
\end{definition}

Every deformation retract is a retract. One can repharse the definition as follows: there is a
continuous \(F:X\times\bI\to X\) s.t. \(F(x,0)=x\) for all \(x\in X\), \(F(x,1)\in A\) for all \(x\in X\),
and \(F(a,1)=a\) for all \(a\in A\) (in this formulation we have \(r(x)=F(x,1)\)).

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(A\) is a deformation retract of \(X\), then \(A\) and \(X\) have the same homotopy type.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[]
\(S^1\) is a deformation retract of \(\bC-\{0\}\) and so these spaces have the same homotopy type.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Write each nonzero complex number \(z\) in polar coordinates
\begin{equation*}
z=\rho e^{i\theta},\quad\rho>0,0\le\theta<2\pi
\end{equation*}
Define \(F:(\bC-\{0\})\times\bI\to\bC-\{0\}\) by
\begin{equation*}
F(\rho e^{i\theta},t)=[(1-t)\rho+t]e^{i\theta}
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex1.29}
For \(n\ge 1\), show that \(S^n\) is a deformation retract of \(\R^{n+1}-\{0\}\)

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(f:X\to Y\) be continuous and  define \footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint\_union\_(topology)}{definition}}
\begin{equation*}
M_f=((X\times\bI)\coprod Y)/\sim
\end{equation*}
where \((x,t)\sim y\) if \(y=f(x)\) and \(t=1\). Denote the class of \((x,t)\) in \(M_f\)
by \([x,t]\) and the class of \(y\) in \(M_f\) by \([y]\) (so that \([x,1]=[f(x)]\)). The
space \(M_f\)is called the \textbf{mapping cylinder} of \(f\)

\subsection{Affine Spaces}
\label{sec:org3536fb1}
\begin{definition}[]
A subset \(A\) of euclidean space is called \textbf{affine} if for every pair of distinct
points \(x,x'\in A\), the line determined by \(x,x'\) is contained in \(A\)
\end{definition}

Observe that affine subsets are convex

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(\{X_j:j\in J\}\) is a family of convex (or affine) subsets of \(\R^n\), then \(\bigcup X_j\) is also
convex (or affine)
\end{theorem}

It thus makes sense to speak of the \textbf{convex} (\textbf{affine}) \textbf{set} in \(\R^n\) \textbf{spanned} by a subset \(X\)
of \(\R^n\) (also called the \textbf{convex hull} of \(X\)), namely, the intersection of all convex (affine)
subsets of \(\R^n\) containing \(X\). We denote the convex set spanned by \(X\) by \([X]\)

\begin{definition}[]
An \textbf{affine combination} of points \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\) in \(\R^n\) is a point with
\begin{equation*}
x=t_0p_0+t_1p_1+\dots+t_mp_m
\end{equation*}
where \(\sum_{i=0}^mt_i=1\). A \textbf{convex combination} is an affine combination for which \(t_i\ge 0\) for all \(i\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.2}
If \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\in\R^n\), then \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\) is the set of all convex combinations of \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \(S\) denote the set of all convex combinations

\([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\subset S\): it suffices to show that \(S\) is a convex set containing \(\{p_0,\dots,p_m\}\).
First, if we set \(t_j=1\) and the other \(t_i=0\), then we see that \(p_j\in S\) for every \(j\).
Second, let \(\alpha=\sum a_ip_i\) and \(\beta=\sum b_ip_i\in S\), where \(a_i,b_i\ge 0\) and \(\sum a_i=1=\sum b_i\). We claim
that \(t\alpha+(1-t)\beta\in S\) for \(t\in\bI\).

\(S\subset[p_0,\dots,p_m]\): if \(X\) is any convex set containing \(\{p_0,\dots,p_m\}\), we show
that \(S\subset X\) by induction on \(m\ge 0\). If \(m=0\), then \(S=\{p_0\}\) and we are done.
Let \(m>0\). If \(t_i\ge 0\) and \(\sum t_i=1\). assume that \(t_0\neq 0\); by induction
\begin{equation*}
q=\left( \frac{t_1}{1-t_0} \right)p_1+\dots+\left( \frac{t_m}{1-t_0} \right)p_m\in X
\end{equation*}
and so
\begin{equation*}
p=t_0p_0+(1-t_0)q\in X
\end{equation*}
because \(X\) is convex
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
\label{cor2.3}
The affine set spanned by \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\subset\R^n\) consists of all affine combinations of these points
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[]
An ordered set of points \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\subset\R^n\) is \textbf{affine independent}
if \(\{p_1-p_0,p_2-p_0,\dots,p_m-p_0\}\) is a linearly independent subset of the real vector space \(\R^n\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
\label{thm2.4}
The following conditions on an ordered set of points \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) in \(\R^n\) are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) is affine independent
\item if \(\{s_0,s_1,\dots,s_m\}\subset\R\) satisfies \(\sum_{i=0}^ms_ip_i=0\) and \(\sum_{i=0}^ms_i=0\), then \(s_0=s_1=\dots=s_m=0\)
\item each \(x\in A\), the affine set spanned by \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) has a unique expression as an
affine combination
\begin{equation*}
x=\sum_{i=0}^mt_ip_i \quad\text{ and }\quad
\sum_{i=0}^mt_i=1
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\(1\to 2\). Assume that \(\sum s_i=0\) and that \(\sum s_ip_i=0\). Then
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^ms_ip_i=\sum_{i=0}^ms_ip_i-\left( \sum_{i=0}^ms_i \right)=
\sum_{i=0}^ms_i(p_i-p_0)=\sum_{i=1}^ms_i(p_i-p_0)
\end{equation*}
Affine independence of \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) gives linear independence of \(\{p_1-p_0,\dots,p_m-p_0\}\),
hence \(s_i=0\) for all \(i=1,2,\dots,m\). Finally \(\sum s_i=0\) implies that \(s_0=0\) as well

\(2\to 3\). Assume that \(x\in A\). By Corollary \ref{cor2.3},
\begin{equation*}
x=\sum_{i=0}^mt_ip_i
\end{equation*}
where \(\sum_{i=0}^mt_i=1\). If also
\begin{equation*}
x=\sum_{i=0}^mt_i'p_i
\end{equation*}
where \(\sum_{i=0}^mt_i'=1\), then
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum_{i=0}^m(t_i-t_i')p_i
\end{equation*}
Since \(\sum(t_i-t_i')=\sum t_i-\sum t_i'=1-1=0\), it follows that \(t_i-t_i'=0\) for all \(i\) and \(t_i=t_i'\)
for all \(i\) as desired

\(3\to 1\). We may assume that \(m\neq 0\). Assume that each \(x\in A\) has a unique expression as an
affine combination of \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\). We shall reach a contradiction by assuming
that \(\{p_1-p_0,\dots,p_m-p_0\}\) is linearly dependent. If so, there would be real numbers \(r_i\), not
all zero, with
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum_{i=1}^mr_i(p_i-p_0)
\end{equation*}
Let \(r_j\neq 0\) and assume its 1. Now \(p_j\in A\)  has two expressions as an affine combination
of \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\)
\begin{align*}
&p_j=1p_j\\
&p_j=-\sum_{i\neq j}r_ip_i+\left( 1+\sum_{i\neq j}r_i \right)p_0
\end{align*}
where \(1\le i\le m\) in the summations
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[]
Affine independence is a property of the set \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) that is independent of the given ordering
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[]
If \(A\) is the affine set in \(\R^n\) spanned by an affine independent set \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\),
then \(A\) is a translate of an \(m\)-dimensional sub-vector-space \(V\) of \(\R^n\), namely,
\begin{equation*}
A=V+x_0
\end{equation*}
for some \(x_0\in\R^n\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[]
A set of points \(\{a_1,\dots,a_k\}\) in \(\R^n\) is in \textbf{general position} if every \(n+1\) of its points
forms an affine independent set
\end{definition}

Assume that \(\{a_1,\dots,a_k\}\subset\R^n\) is in general position. If \(n=1\), we are saying that every
pair \(\{a_i,a_j\}\) is affine independent; that is, all the points are distinct. If \(n=2\), we are
saying that no three points are collinear, and if \(n=3\), that no four points are coplanar

Let \(r_0,r_1,\dots,r_m\) be real numbers. The \((m+1)\times(m+1)\) \textbf{Vandermonde matrix} \(V\) has as
its \(i\)th column \([1,r_i,r_i^2,\dots,r_i^m]\); moreover, \(\det V=\prod_{j<i}(r_i-r_j)\), hence \(V\) is
nonsingular if all the \(r_i\) are distinct. If one substracts column 0 from each of the other
columns of \(V\), then the \(i\)th column (for \(i>0\)) of the new matrix is
\begin{equation*}
[0,r_i-r_0,r_i^2-r_0^2,\dots,r_i^m-r_0^m]
\end{equation*}
If \(V^*\) is the southeast \(m\times m\) block of this new matrix, then \(\det V^*=\det V\)

\begin{theorem}[]
For every \(k\ge 0\), euclidean space \(\R^n\) contains \(k\) points in general position
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We may assume that \(k>n+1\) (otherwise, choose the origin together with \(k-1\) elements of a
basis). Select \(k\) distinct reals \(r_1,r_2,\dots,r_k\) and for each \(i=1,2,\dots, k\), define
\begin{equation*}
a_i=(r_i,r_i^2,\dots,r_i^n)\in\R^n
\end{equation*}
We claim that \(\{a_1,\dots,a_k\}\) is in general position. If not, there are \(n+1\)
points \(\{a_{i_0},\dots,a_{i_n}\}\) not affine independent,
hence \(\{a_{i_1}-a_{i_0},\dots,a_{i_n}-a_{i_0}\}\) is linearly dependent. There are thus real
numbers \(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\), not all zero, with
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum s_j(a_{i_j}-a_{i_0})=(\sum s_j(r_{i_j}-r_{i_0}),
\sum s_j(r_{i_j}^2-r_{i_0}^2),\dots,\sum s_j(r_{i_j}^n-r_{i_0}^n))
\end{equation*}
If \(V^*\) is the \(n\times n\) southeast block of the \((n+1)\times(n+1)\) Vandermonde matrix obtained
from \(r_{i_0},r_{i_1},\dots,r_{i_n}\), and if \(\sigma\) is the column vector \(\sigma=(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)\), then the
vector equation above is \(V^*\sigma=0\). But since all the \(r_i\) are distinct, \(V^*\) is
nonsingular and \(\sigma=0\), contradicting our hypothesis that not all the \(s_i\) are zero
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) be an affine independent subset of \(\R^n\), and let \(A\) be the affine set
spanned by this subset. If \(x\in A\), then Theorem \ref{thm2.4} gives a
unique \((m+1)\)-tuple \((t_0,t_1,\dots,t_m)\) with \(\sum t_i=1\) and \(x=\sum_{i=0}^mt_ip_i\). The entries of
this \((m+1)\)-tuple are called the \textbf{barycentric coordinates} of \(x\) (relative to the ordered set
\(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\))
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) be an affine independent subset of \(\R^n\). The convex set spanned by this
set, denoted by \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\), is called the (affine) \textbf{\(m\)-simplex} with \textbf{vertices} \(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\) is affine independent, then each \(x\) in
the \(m\)-simplex \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\) has a unique expression of the form
\begin{equation*}
x=\sum t_ip_i,\quad\text{ where }\sum t_i=1\text{ and each }t_i\ge 0
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Theorem \ref{thm2.2} shows that every \(x\in[p_0,\dots,p_m]\) is such a convex combination
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
If \(\{p_0,\dots,p_m\}\) is affine independent, the \textbf{barycenter} of \([p_0,\dots,p_m]\) is \((1/m+1)(p_0+p_1+\dots+p_m)\)
\end{definition}

\begin{examplle}[]
The 1-simplex \([p_0,p_1]=\{t p_0+(1-t)p_1:t\in\bI\}\) is the closed line segment with
endpoints \(p_0,p_1\).
\end{examplle}

\begin{examplle}[]
The 2-simplex \([p_0,p_1,p_2]\) is a triangle (with interior) with vertices \(p_0,p_1,p_2\); the
barycenter \(\frac{1}{3}(p_0+p_1+p_2)\) is the center of gravity.  Note that the three edges
are \([p_0,p_1]\), \([p_1,p_2]\) and \([p_2,p_2]\)

\begin{examplle}[]
The 3-simplex \([p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3]\) is the (solid) tetrahedron with vertices \(p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3\)

For \(i=0,1,\dots,n\), let \(e_i\) denote the point in \(\R^{n+1}\) having (cartesian) coordinates all
zeros except for 1 in the \((i+1)\)st position. \(\{e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n\}\) is affine independent.
Now \([e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n]\) consists of all convex combinations \(x=\sum t_ie_i\). In this case,
barycentric and cartesian coordinates \((t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n)\) coincide, and \([e_0,e_1,\dots,e_n]=\Delta^n\) ,
the standard \(n\)-simplex
\end{examplle}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\) be an \(m\)-simplex. The \textbf{face opposite} \(p_i\) is

 \right\}
\end{equation*}
The \textbf{boundary} of \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\) is the union of its faces
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
Let \(S\) denote the \(n\)-simplex \([p_0,\dots,p_n]\)
\begin{enumerate}
\item if \(u,v\in S\) then \(\norm{u-v}\le\sup_i\norm{u-p_i}\)
\item \(\diam S=\sup_{i,j}\norm{p_i-p_j}\)
\item if \(b\) is the barycenter of \(S\), then \(\norm{b-p_i}\le(n/n+1)\diam S\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(v=\sum t_ip_i\), where \(t_i\ge 0\) and \(\sum t_i=1\). Therefore
\begin{align*}
\norm{u-v}&=\norm{u-\sum t_ip_i}=\norm{(\sum t_i)u-\sum t_ip_i}\\
&\le \sum t_i\norm{u-p_i}\le \sum t_i\sup_i\norm{u-p_i}=\sup_i\norm{u-p_i}
\end{align*}
\item By 1, \(\norm{u-p_i}\le\sup_j\norm{p_j-p_i}\)
\item Since \(b=(1/n+1)\sum p_i\), we have
\begin{align*}
\norm{b-p_i}&=\norm{\sum_{j=0}^n(1/n+1)p_j-p_i}=\norm{\sum_{j=0}^n(1/n+1)p_j-
\left( \sum_{j=0}^n(1/n+1) \right)p_i}\\
&=\norm{\sum_{j=0}^n(1/n+1)(p_j-p_i)}\\
&\le (1/n+1)\sum_{j=0}^n\norm{p_j-p_i}\\
&\le(n/n+1)\sup_{i,j}\norm{p_j-p_i}\quad(\text{for }\norm{p_j-p_i}=0\text{ when }j=i)\\
&=(n/n+1)\diam S
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:orgda2779f}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\{p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m\}\subset\R^n\) be affine independent and let \(A\) denote the affine set it spans. An
\textbf{affine map} \(T:A\to\R^k\) (for some \(k\ge 1\)) is a function satisfying
\begin{equation*}
T(\sum t_jp_j)=\sum t_jT(p_j)
\end{equation*}
whenever \(\sum t_j=1\). The restriction of \(T\) to \([p_0,p_1,\dots,p_m]\) is also called an \textbf{affine map}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
If \([p_0,\dots,p_m]\) is an \(m\)-simplex, \([q_0,\dots,q_n]\) an \(n\)-simplex,
and \(f:\{p_0,\dots,p_m\}\to[q_0,\dots,q_n]\) any function, then there exists a unique affine
map \(T:[p_0,\dots,p_m]\to[q_0,\dots,q_n]\) with \(T(p_i)=f(p_i)\) for \(i=0,1,\dots,m\)
\end{theorem}

\section{The Fundamental Group}
\label{sec:org1a3325b}

\subsection{The Fundamental Groupoid}
\label{sec:orgfba7f1f}
\begin{definition}[]
Let \(f,g:\bI\to X\) be paths with \(f(1)=g(0)\). Define  a path \(f*g:\bI\to X\) by
\begin{equation*}
(f*g)(t)=
\begin{cases}
f(2t)&0\le t\le 1/2\\
g(2t-1)&1/2\le t\le 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

The gluing lemma shows that \(f*g\) is continuous, and so \(f*g\) is path in \(X\). Our aim is to
construct a group whose elements are certain homotopy classes of paths in \(X\) with binary
operation \([f][g]=[f*g]\). Now if we impose the rather mild condition that \(X\) be path
connected, then contractibility of \(\bI\) implies that all maps \(\bI\to X\) are homotopic (Exercise
\ref{ex1.19}); thus there is only one homotopy class of maps.

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(A\subset X\) and \(f_0,f_1:X\to Y\) be continuous maps with \(f_0|A=f_1|A\). We write
\begin{equation*}
f_0\simeq f_1\rel A
\end{equation*}
if there is a continuous map \(F:X\times\bI\to Y\) with \(F:f_0\simeq f_1\) and
\begin{equation*}
F(a,t)=f_0(a)=f_1(a)\quad\text{for all }a\in A\text{ and all }t\in\bI
\end{equation*}
The homotopy \(F\) above is called a \textbf{relative homotopy} (a homotopy \(\rel A\)); in contrast, the
original definition (which may be viewed as a homotopy \(\rel A=\emptyset\)) is called a \textbf{free homotopy}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
Let \(\dbI=\{0,1\}\) be the boundary of \(\bI\) in \(\R\). The equivalence class of a
path \(f:\bI\to X\rel\dbI\) is called the \textbf{path class} of \(f\) and is denoted by \([f]\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[]
Assume that \(f_0,f_1,g_0,g_1\) are paths in \(X\) with
\begin{equation*}
f_0\simeq f_1\rel\dbI \quad\text{ and }\quad
g_0\simeq g_1\rel\dbI
\end{equation*}
If \(f_0(1)=f_1(1)=g_0(0)=g_1(0)\) then \(f_0*g_0\simeq f_1*g_1\rel\dbI\)
\end{theorem}

In path class notation, if \([f_0]=[f_1]\) and \([g_0]=[g_1]\), then \([f_0*g_0]=[f_1*g_1]\)

\begin{proof}
If \(F:f_0\simeq f_1\rel\dbI\) and \(G:g_0\simeq g_1\rel\dbI\), then \(H:\bI\times\bI\to X\) defined by
\begin{equation*}
H(t,s)=
\begin{cases}
F(2t,s)&0\le t\le 1/2\\
G(2t-1,s)&1/2\le t\le 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
is a continuous map that is a relative homotopy \(f_0*g_0\simeq f_1*g_1\rel\dbI\)
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.1}
Generalize Theorem \ref{thm1.3} as follows. Let \(A\subset X\) and \(B\subset Y\) be given. Assume
that \(f_0,f_1:X\to Y\) with \(f_0|A=f_1|A\) and \(f_i(A)\subset B\) for \(i=0,1\); assume
that \(g_0,g_1:Y\to Z\) with \(g_0|B=g_1|B\). If \(f_0\simeq f_1\rel A\)  and \(g_0\simeq g_1\rel B\), then
\(g_0\circ f_0\simeq g_1\circ f_1\rel A\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Visibly, for all \(a\in A\), \(g_0\circ f_0(a)=g_1\circ f_1(a)\). Then follows the proof of the theorem
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(f:\bI\to X\) is a path with \(f(0)=f(1)=x_0\in X\), then there is a continuous \(f':S^1\to X\)
given by \(f'(e^{2\pi it})=f(t)\). If \(f,g:\bI\to X\) are paths with \(f(0)=f(1)=x_0=g(0)=g(1)\) and
if \(f\simeq g\rel\dbI\), then \(f'\simeq g'\rel\{1\}\) (\(1=e^0\))
\item If \(f\) and \(g\) are as above, then \(f\simeq f_1\rel\dbI\) and \(g\simeq g_1\rel\dbI\) implies
that \(f'*g'\simeq f_1'*g_1'\rel\{1\}\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let \(k:S^1\to\bI\) with \(k(2^{2\pi it})=t\). Then \(f'=f\circ k\) and \(g'=g\circ k\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[]
If \(f:\bI\to X\) is a path from \(x_0\) to \(x_1\), call \(x_0\) the \textbf{origin} of \(f\) and
write \(x_0=\alpha(f)\); call \(x_1\) the \textbf{end} of \(f\) and write \(x_1=\omega(f)\). A path \(f\)  in \(X\) is
\textbf{closed} at \(x_0\) if \(\alpha(f)=x_0=\omega(f)\)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[]
If \(p\in X\) then the constant function \(i_p:\bI\to X\) with \(i_p(t)=p\) for all \(t\in\bI\) is called
the \textbf{constant path} at \(p\). If \(f:\bI\to X\) is a path, its \textbf{inverse} path \(f^{-1}(x:\bI\to X)\) is
defined by \(t\mapsto f(1-t)\)
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.4}
Let \(\sigma:\Delta^2\to X\) be continuous, where \(\Delta^2=[e_0,e_1,e_2]\)

\label{}
\end{figure}

Define \(\epsilon_0:\bI\to \Delta^2\) as the affine map with \(\epsilon_0(0)=e_1\) and \(\epsilon_0(1)=e_2\); similarly,
define \(\epsilon_1\) by \(\epsilon_1(0)=e_0\) and \(\epsilon_1(1)=e_2\) and define \(\epsilon_2(0)=e_0\) and \(\epsilon_2(1)=e_1\).
Finally define \(\sigma_i=\sigma\circ\epsilon_i\) for \(i=0,1,2\)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that \((\sigma_0*\sigma^{-1}_1)*\sigma_2\) is nullhomotopic \(\rel\dbI\)
\item Let \(F:\bI\times\bI\to X\) be continuous, and define paths \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), \(\delta\) in \(X\) as indicated in the
figure
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../images/AnIntroductionToAlgebraicTopology/7.png}
\label{}
\end{figure}
Thus \(\alpha(t)=F(t,0)\), \(\beta(t)=F(t,1)\), \(\gamma(t)=F(0,t)\) and \(\delta(t)=F(1,t)\). Prove
that \(\alpha\simeq\gamma*\beta*\delta^{-1}\rel\dbI\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.5}
Let \(f_0\simeq f_1\rel\dbI\) and \(g_0\simeq g_1\rel\dbI\) be paths in \(X\) and \(Y\), respectively. If,
for \(i=0,1\), \((f_i,g_i)\) is the path in \(X\times Y\) defined by \(t\mapsto(f_i(t),g_i(t))\), prove
that \((f_0,g_0)\simeq (f_1,g_1)\rel\dbI\)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex3.6}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If \(f\simeq g\rel\dbI\) then \(f^{-1}\simeq g^{-1}\rel\dbI\), where \(f,g\) are paths in \(X\)
\item if \(f\) and \(g\) are paths in \(X\) with \(\omega(f)=\alpha(g)\), then
\begin{equation*}
(f*g)^{-1}=g^{-1}*f^{-1}
\end{equation*}
\item Given an example of a closed path \(f\) with \(f*f^{-1}\neq f^{-1}*f\)
\item Show that if \(\alpha(f)=p\) and \(f\) is notconstant, then \(i_p*f\neq f\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}[]
If \(X\) is a space, then the set of all path classes in \(X\) under the (not always defined)
binary operation \([f][g]=[f*g]\) forms an algebraic system (called a \textbf{groupoid}) satisfying the
following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item each path class \([f]\) has an origin \(\alpha[f]=p\in X\) and an end \(\omega[f]=q\in X\) and
\begin{equation*}
[i_p][f]=[f]=[f][i_q]
\end{equation*}
\item associativity holds whenever possible
\item if \(p=\alpha[f]\) and \(q=\omega[f]\), then
\begin{equation*}
[f][f^{-1}]=[i_p] \quad\text{ and }\quad [f^{-1}][f]=[i_q]
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that \(i_p*f\simeq f\rel\dbI\)

First, draw the line in \(\bI\times\bI\) joining \((0,1)\) to \((1/2,0)\); its equation is \(2s=1-t\).
For fixed \(t\), define \(\theta_t:[(1/t)/2,1]\to[0,1]\) as the affine map matching the endpoints of
these intervals. By Exercise \ref{ex2.7}
