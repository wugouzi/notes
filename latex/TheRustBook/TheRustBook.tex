use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()

Result's variants are \texttt{Ok} and \texttt{Err}. The \texttt{Ok} variant indicates the operation was successful, and
inside \texttt{Ok} is the successfully generated value. The \texttt{Err} variant means the operation failed, and
Err contains information about how or why the operation failed.

An instance of \texttt{Result} has an expect method that you can call. If this instance of \texttt{Result} is an
\texttt{Err} value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to expect.

If the \texttt{read\_line} method returns an \texttt{Err}, it would likely be the result of an error coming from
the underlying operating system. If this instance of \texttt{Result} is an \texttt{Ok} value, expect will take the
return value that \texttt{Ok} is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it. In this
case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.

If you don’t call \texttt{expect}, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:
