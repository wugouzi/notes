abstract="Starting from the topological point of view a certain wide class of To-spaces is introduced having a very strong extension property for continuous functions with values in these spaces. It is then shown that all such spaces are complete lattices whose lattice structure determines the topology --- these are the continuous lattices --- and every such lattice has the extension property. With this foundation the lattices are studied in detail with respect to projections, subspaces, embeddings, and constructions such as products, sums, function spaces, and inverse limits. The main result of the paper is a proof that every topological space can be embedded in a continuous lattice which is homeomorphic (and isomorphic) to its own function space. The function algebra of such spaces provides mathematical models for the Church-Curry $\lambda$-calculus.",

Using the cell decomposition theorem we obtain a full classification of Presburger sets up to definable bijection. We also exhibit a tight connection between the definable sets in an arbitrary p-minimal field and Presburger sets in its value group. We give a negative result about expansions of Presburger structures and prove uniform elimination of imaginaries for Presburger structures within the Presburger language.},

Let G be a group definable in M (i.e. G is a definable subset of Mn and the graph of multiplication is also definable). We show that G can be definably equipped with the structure of a ‘manifold’ over M in which multiplication and inversion are continuous. In the special case M = (R, <, +, ·) our construction gives G the structure of a Nash group. These results are also used to show that an infinite field definable in an o-minimal structure is real closed or algebraically closed.}

 abstract = {This paper introduces and begins the study of a well-behaved class of linearly ordered structures, the O-minimal structures. The definition of this class and the corresponding class of theories, the strongly O-minimal theories, is made in analogy with the notions from stability theory of minimal structures and strongly minimal theories. Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, respectively, provide characterizations of O-minimal ordered groups and rings. Several other simple results are collected in $\S3$. The primary tool in the analysis of O-minimal structures is a strong analogue of "forking symmetry," given by Theorem 4.2. This result states that any (parametrically) definable unary function in an O-minimal structure is piecewise either constant or an order-preserving or reversing bijection of intervals. The results that follow include the existence and uniqueness of prime models over sets (Theorem 5.1) and a characterization of all ℵ0-categorical O-minimal structures (Theorem 6.1).},

Both cases involve discs, forming "Swiss cheeses" in the algebraically closed case, and cuts in the real closed case. As a step in the development, we give a proof for the fact that in "most" valued fields F, if f(x),g(x) ∈ F[ x] and v is the valuation map, then the set {x : v(f(x)) ≤ v(g(x))} is a Boolean combination of discs; in fact, it is a finite union of Swiss cheeses. The development also depends on the introduction of "valued trees", which we define formally.},
