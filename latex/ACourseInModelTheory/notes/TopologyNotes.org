   A *topology* on a set is a collection \(\calt\) of subsets of \(X\) having the following properties
   1. \(\emptyset\) and \(X\) are in \(\calt\)
   2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of \(\calt\) is in \(T\)
   3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of \(\calt\) is in \(\calt\)


   A set \(X\) for which a topology \(\calt\) has been specified is called a *topological space*

   #+BEGIN_definition
   If \(X\) is a set, a *basis* for a topology on \(X\) is a collection \(\calb\) of subsets of \(X\)
   (called *basis element*) s.t.
   1. for each \(x\in X\), there is at least one basis element \(B\) s.t. \(x\in B\)
   2. if \(x\in B_1\cap B_2\), then there is a basis element \(B_3\) s.t. \(x\in B_3\subset B_1\cap B_2\)


   If \(\calb\) satisfies these conditions, then we define the *topology \(\calt\) generated by \(\calb\)* as
   follows: A subset \(U\) of \(X\) is said to be open in \(X\) if for each \(x\in U\), there is a
   basis \(B\in\calb\) s.t. \(x\in B\subset U\).

   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\calt\). If \(Y\subseteq X\), then
   \begin{equation*}
   \calt_Y=\{Y\cap U\mid U\in\calt\}
   \end{equation*}
   is a topology on \(Y\), called the *subspace topology*. With this topology, \(Y\) is called a
   *subspace* of \(X\)

   If \(X\) is a space, a point \(x\in X\) is said to be an *isolated point* of \(X\) if the one-point
   set \(\{x\}\) is open in \(X\)

   #+BEGIN_definition
   A collection \(\cala\) of subsets of a space \(X\) is said to *cover* \(X\), or to be a *covering*
   of \(X\), if \(\bigcup\cala=X\). It is called an *open covering* of \(X\) if its elements are open subsets of \(X\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A space \(X\) is said to be *compact* if every open covering \(\cala\) of \(X\) contains a finite
   subcollection that also covers \(X\).
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A collection \(\calc\)  of subsets of \(X\) is said to have the *finite intersection property* if for
   every finite subcollection
   \begin{equation*}
   \{C_1,\dots,C_n\}
   \end{equation*}
   of \(\calc\), the intersection \(C_1\cap\dots\cap C_n\) is nonempty
   #+END_definition

   #+BEGIN_theorem
   label:thm26.9
   Let \(X\) be a topological space. Then \(X\) is compact iff for every collection \(\calc\) of closed
   sets in \(X\) having the finite intersection property, the intersection \(\bigcap_{C\in\calc}C\) is nonempty
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Given a collection \(\cala\) of subsets of \(X\), let
   \begin{equation*}
   \calc=\{X-A\mid A\in\cala\}
   \end{equation*}
   Then the following holds
   1. \(\cala\) is a collection of open sets iff \(\calc\) is a collection of closed sets
   2. The collection \(\cala\) covers \(X\) iff the intersection \(\bigcap_{C\in\calc}C\) is empty
   3. The finite subcollection \(\{A_1,\dots,A_n\}\) of \(\cala\) covers \(X\) iff \(\bigcap C_i\) is empty


   Take the contrapositive of the theorem: given any collection \(\cala\) of open sets, if no finite
   subcollection of \(\cala\) covers \(X\), then \(\cala\) does not cover \(X\), which is equivalent to:
   given any collection \(\calc\) of closed sets, if every finite intersection of elements of \(\calc\) is
   nonempty, then the intersection of all the elements of \(\calc\) is nonempty
   #+END_proof






    #+BEGIN_definition
    A collection \(\cala\) of subsets of the space \(X\) is said to have *order* \(m+1\) if some point
    of \(X\) lies in \(m+1\) elements of \(\cala\), and no point of \(X\) lies in more than \(m+1\)
    elements of \(\cala\).
    #+END_definition

    Given a collection \(\cala\) of subsets of \(X\), a collection \(\calb\) is said to *refine* \(\cala\), or to
    be a *refinement* of \(\cala\), if for each element \(B\) of \(\calb\) there is an element \(A\) of \(\cala\)
    s.t. \(B\subset A\)

    #+BEGIN_definition
    A space \(X\) is said to be *finite dimensional* if there is some integer \(m\) s.t. for every
    open covering \(\cala\) of \(X\), there is an open covering \(\calb\) of \(X\) that refines \(\cala\) and
    has order at most \(m+1\). The *topological dimension* of \(X\) is defined to be the smallest
    value of \(m\) for which this statement holds; we denote it by \(\dim X\).
