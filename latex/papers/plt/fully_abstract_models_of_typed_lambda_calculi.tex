\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org895c4ba}
A denotational semantic definition of \(L\) consists of a semantic domain \(D\) of meanings, and a
semantic interpretation \(\cala:L\to D\). We assume that we are mainly interested in the semantics of
programs. Denote by \(\calc[\quad]\) a program context - that is, a program with a hole in it, to be
filled by a pharase of some kind.

One desirable property of \(\cala\) is that for all phrases \(M\) and \(N\) we have
\(\cala\llb{\calc[M]}=\cala\llb{\calc[N]}\) whenever \(\cala\llb{M}=\cala\llb{N}\).

This is not hard to achieve, particularly if \(\cala\) is given as a homomorphism. But it is
unfortunate if for some \(M\) and \(N\) s.t. \(\cala\llb{M}\neq\cala\llb{N}\) it nevertheless holds
for \emph{all} program contexts that \(\cala\llb{\calc[M]}=\cala\llb{\calc[N]}\); it means that \(\cala\)
distinguishes finely among nonprogram phrases.

The reason for describing this situation as 'over-generous' is that it typically arises when there are
many objects in \(D\) which cannot be realized (i.e., denoted by a phrase). For example,
\(\cala\llb{M}\) and \(\cala\llb{N}\) may be functions which only differ at an unrealizable argument,
which can never be supplied to the functions in a program context.
\label{1}

So we wish to find \(D\) and \(\cala\) s.t.
\begin{equation*}
\CA{M}\sqsubseteq\CA{N}\quad\text{ iff }\quad\forall\calc[\quad].\CA{M}\sqsubseteq\CA{N}
\end{equation*}
