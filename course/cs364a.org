        [[../images/Misc/2.png]]
        There is a suburb \(s\), a train station \(t\), and a fixed number of drivers who wish to commute from
        \(s\) to \(t\). For the moment, assume two non-interfering routes from \(s\) to \(t\), each comprising
        one long wide road (with travel time one hour, no matter how much traﬃc uses it) and one short narrow
        road (with travel time in hours equal to the fraction of traﬃc using it) as shown in Figure [[ref:1]](a).
        The combined travel time in hours of the two edges on one of these routes is \(1 + x\), where \(x\) is
        the fraction of the traﬃc that uses the route. The routes are therefore identical, and traﬃc should
        split evenly between them. In this case, all drivers arrive at their destination 90 minutes after
        their departure from \(s\).

        Now, suppose we install a teleportation device allowing drivers to travel instantly from \(v\) to
        \(w\). The new network is shown in Figure [[ref:1]](b), with the teleporter represented by edge \((v,w)\)
        with constant cost \(c(x)=0\), how will the drivers react?

        Braess’s Paradox thus shows that the intuitively helpful action of adding a new zero-cost link can negatively impact all of the traﬃc!
* Mechanism Design basics
        The first key assumption is that each bidder \(i\) has a valuation \(v_i\) — its maximum
        willingness-to-pay for the item being sold.

        Our bidder utility model, called the *quasilinear utility model*, is as follows. If a bidder loses an
        auction, its utility is 0. If the bidder wins at a price p, then its utility is \(v_i-p\).

        *Sealed-bid auctions*:
        1. Each bidder \(i\) privately communicates a bid \(b_i\) to the auctioner
        2. The auctioneer decides who get the good
        3. The auctioneer decides on a selling price.

        A much more reasonable choice is to ask the winning bidder to pay its bid. This is called a
        *first-price auction*, and such auction are common in practice.

        A *second-price* or *Vickrey* auction is a sealed-bid auction in which the highest bidder wins and pays a
        price equal to the second-highest bid.

        #+BEGIN_claim
        [[label:4.1]]
        In a second-price auction, every bidder has a dominant strategy: set its bid \(b_i\) equal to its
        private valuation \(v_i\).
        #+END_claim

        #+BEGIN_proof
        [[label:4.2]]
        Fix an arbitrary player \(i\), its valuation \(v_i\), and the bids \(\bb_{-i}\) of the other players.
        We need to show that bidder \(i\)'s utility is maximized by setting \(b_i=v_i\).

        Let \(B=\max_{j\neq i}b_j\) denote the highest bid by some other bid. If \(v_i<B\), the highest
        utility that bidder \(i\) can get is 0. If \(v_i\ge B\), the highest utility the bidder \(i\) can get
        is \(v_i-B\), and it achieves this by didding truthfully.
        #+END_proof

        #+BEGIN_claim
        In a second-price auction, every truthtelling bidder is guaranteed non-negative utility
        #+END_claim

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Vickrey]
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        The Vickrey auction is *awesome*. Meaning it enjoys three properties:
        1. *Strong incentitive guarantees*: It is *dominant-strategy incentive-compatible* (*DSIC*), i.e., Claims
           [[ref:4.1]] and [[ref:4.2]] hold
        2. *Strong performance guarantees*: If bidders report truthfully, then the auction maximizes the *social
           surplus*
           \begin{equation*}
           \sum_{i=1}^nv_ix_i
           \end{equation*}
           where \(x_i\) is 1 if \(i\) wins and 0 if \(i\) loses
        3. *Computational efficiency*: The auction can be implemented in polynomial time.
        #+END_theorem

        The surplus-maximization property states something rather amazing: even though the bidder valuations
        were a priori unknown to the auctioneer, the auction nevertheless successfully identifies the bidder
        with the highest valuation!
** Case Study: Sponsored Search Auctions
        The goods for sale are the k “slots” for sponsored links on a search results page. The bidders are the
        advertisers who have a standing bid on the keyword that was searched on.

        We quantify the difference between different slots using *click-through-rates* (CTRs). The CTR
        \(\alpha_j\) of a slot \(j\) represents the probability that the end user clicks on this slot.
        Ordering the slots from top to bottom, we make the reasonable assumption that
        \(\alpha_1\ge \alpha_2\ge\dots\ge\alpha_k\). For simplicity, we also make the unreasonable assumption
        that the CTR of a slot is independent of its occupant. The exercises show how to extend the following
        results to the more general and realistic model in which each advertiser \(i\) has a “quality score”
        \(\beta_i\) (the higher the better) and the CTR of advertiser \(i\) in slot \(j\) is the product
        \(\beta_i\alpha_j\).

        What’s hard about mechanism design problems is that we have to jointly design two things: the choice
        of who wins what, and the choice of who pays what. We can tackle this two-prong design problem one
        step at a time.
        1. Assume, without justification, that bidders bid truthfully. Then, how should we assign bidders to slots so that the above properties (2) and (3) hold?
        2. Given our answer to Step 1, how should we set selling prices so that the above property (1) holds?
* Myerson's Lemma
        A good level of abstraction at which to state Myerson’s Lemma is *single-parameter environments*. Such
        an environment has some number \(n\) of bidders. Each bidder \(i\) has a private valuation \(v_i\) ,
        its value “per unit of stuff” that it gets. Finally, there is a *feasible set* \(X\). Each element of
        \(X\) is an \(n\)-vector \((x_1,\dots,x_n)\), where xi denotes the “amount of stuff” given to bidder
        \(i\). For example:
        * In a single-item auction, \(X\) is the 0-1 vectors that have at most one 1.
        * With \(k\) identical goods and the constraints each customer gets at most one, the feasible set is
          the 0-1 vectors satisfying \(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i\le k\)

        A sealed-bid auction has three steps:
        1. Collect bids \(\bb=(b_1,\dots,b_n)\)
        2. *Allocation rule*: choose a feasible allocation \(\bx(\bb)\in X\subseteq\calr^n\) as a function of
           the bids
        3. *Payment rule*: choose payments \(\bp(\bb)\in\calr^n\) as a function of the bids

        Bidder \(i\) will have utility
        \begin{equation*}
        u_i(\bb)=v_i\cdot x_i(\bb)-p_i(\bb)
        \end{equation*}

        We will focus on payment rules that satisfy
        \begin{equation*}
        p_i(\bb)\in[0,b_i\cdot x_i(\bb)]
        \end{equation*}
        for every \(i\) and \(\bb\). The constraint that \(p_i(\bb)\ge 0\) is equivalent to prohibiting the
        seller from paying the bidders. The constraint that \(p_i(\bb)\le b_i\cdot x_i(\bb)\) ensures that a
        truthtelling bidder receives nonnegative utility.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Implementable Allocation Rule]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        An allocation rule \(\bx\) for a single-parameter environment is *implementable* if there is a payment
        rule \(\bp\) s.t. the seal-bid auction \((\bx,\bp)\) is DSIC
        #+END_definition

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Monotone Allocation Rule]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        An allocation rule \(\bx\) for a single-parameter environment is *monotone* if for every bidder \(i\)
        and bids \(\bb_{-i}\) by the other bidders, the allocation \(x_i(z,\bb_{-i})\) to \(i\) is
        nondecreasing in its bid \(z\).
        #+END_definition

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Myerson's Lemma]
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        Fix a single-parameter environment.
        1. An allocation rule \(\bx\) is implementable iff it is monotone
        2. If \(\bx\) is monotone, then there is a unique payment rule s.t. the sealed-bid mechanim
           \((\bx,\bp)\) is DSIC (assuming the normalization that \(b_i=0\) implies \(p_i(\bb)=0\))
        3. The payment rule in (2) is given by an explicit formula
        #+END_theorem

        #+BEGIN_proof
        Let \(x(z)\) and \(p(z)\) be  \(x_i(z,\bb_{-i})\) and \(p_i(z,\bb_{-i})\)

        Suppose \((\bx,\bp)\) is DSIC, and consider any \(0\le y<z\). Because bidder \(i\) might have private
        valuation \(z\) and can submit the false bid \(y\) if it wants, DSIC demands that
        \begin{equation*}
        z\cdot x(z)-p(z)\ge z\cdot x(y)-p(y)
        \end{equation*}
        Similarly, since bidder \(j\) might have the private valuation \(y\) and could submit the false bid
        \(z\), \((\bx,\bp)\) must satisfy
        \begin{equation*}
        y\cdot x(y)-p(y)\ge y\cdot x(z)-p(z)
        \end{equation*}
        Therefore we have
        \begin{equation*}
        z\cdot[x(y)-x(z)]\le p(y)-p(z)\le y\cdot[x(y)-x(z)]\tag{$\star$}
        \end{equation*}

        Thus we may assume that \(\bx\) is monotone.
        In \((\star)\), fix \(z\) and let \(y\) tends to \(z\) from above. We focus primarily on the case
        where \(x\) is piecewise constant. This implies the following constraints on \(p\), for every \(z\):
        \begin{equation*}
        \text{jump in $p$ at $z$}=z\cdot\text{jump in $x$ at $z$}
        \end{equation*}
        Thus, assuming the normalization \(p(0)=0\), we've derived the following /payment formula/, for every
        bidder \(i\), bids \(\bb_{-i}\) by other bidders, and bids \(b_i\) by \(i\):
        \begin{equation}
        \label{Myerson}
        p_i(b_i,\bb_{-i})=\sum_{j=1}^lz_j\cdot\text{jump in }x_i(\cdot,\bb_{-i})\text{ at }z_j,
        \end{equation}
        where \(z_1,\dots,z_l\) are the breakpoints of the allocation function \(x_i(\cdot,\bb_{-i})\) in the
        range \([0,b_i]\)

        A similar argument applies when \(x\) is a monotone function that is not necessarily piecewise
        constant. For instance, suppose that \(x\) is differential. Dividing the payment difference sandwich
        \((\star)\) by \(y-z\) and taking the limit as \(y\downarrow z\) yields the constraint
        \begin{equation*}
        p'(z)=z\cdot x'(z)
        \end{equation*}
        and assuming \(p(0)=0\), the payment formula
        \begin{equation*}
        p_i(b_i,\bb_{-i})=\int_0^{b_i}z\cdot\frac{d}{dz}x_i(z,\bb_{-i})dz
        \end{equation*}
        for every bidder \(i\), bid \(b_i\), and bids \(\bb_{-i}\) by the others

        #+END_proof

** Applying the Payment Formula: Sponsored Search Solved
        Consider a single-item auction with the allocation rule that allocates the good to the highest bidder.
        Fixing \(i\) and \(\bb_{-i}\), the function \(x_i(\cdot,\bb_{-i})\) is 0 up to \(B=\max_{j\neq b_j}\)
        and 1 thereafter. Thus Myerson's Lemma regenerates the Vickrey auction as a  special case.

        Back to sponsored search auctions. Applying Myerson's Lemma, we can derive a unique payment rule
        \(\bp\) s.t. \((\bx,\bp)\) is DSIC. Consider a bid profile \(\bb\), we can re-index the bidders so
        that \(b_1\ge b_2\ge\dots\ge b_n\). Then, Myerson's payment formula specializes to
        \begin{equation*}
        p_i(\bb)=\sum_{j=i}^kb_{j+1}(\alpha_j-\alpha_{j+1})
        \end{equation*}
        for the \(i\)th highest bidder.

* Algorithmic Mechanism Design
** Knapsack Auctions
        In a knapsack auction, each bidder \(i\) has a publicly known *size* \(w_i\) (e.g., the duration of a TV
        ad) and a private valuation. The seller has a capacity \(W\). The feasible set \(X\) is defined as the
        0-1 \(n\)-vectors \((x_1,\dots,x_n)\) s.t. \(\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i\le W\).

        Let’s try to design an awesome auction using our two-step design paradigm. Recall that we first assume
        without justification that bids equal values and then decide on our allocation rule. Then we pay the
        piper and devise a payment rule that extends the allocation rule to a DSIC mechanism.

        Allocation rule:
        \begin{equation*}
        \bx(\bb)=\arg\max_X\sum_{i=1}^nb_ix_i
        \end{equation*}

        Myerson's Lemma guarantees the existence of a payment rule \(\bp\) s.t. the mechanism \((\bx,\bp)\) is
        DSIC. Fix a bidder \(i\) and bids \(\bb_{-i}\) by the other bidders. Since the allocation rule is
        monotone and 0-1, the allocation curve \(x_i(\cdot,\bb_{-i})\) is simple: it is 0 until some
        breakpoint \(z\).

        Thus, if \(i\) bids less than \(z\), it loses and pays 0. If \(i\) bids more than \(z\), it pays
        \(z\cdot(1-0)=z\) .

        As Knapsack problem is NP-hard, there is no polynomial-time implementation of the allocation rule.
        Thus there is no awesome knapsack auction (assuming \(P\neq NP\)) motivates relaxing at least one of
        the awesome goals.
** Algorithmic Mechanism Design
        The dominant paradigm in algorithmic mechanism design is to relax the second constraint (optimal
        surplus) as little as possible, subject to the first (DSIC) and third (polynomial-time) constraints.
        For single-parameter environments, Myerson’s Lemma implies that the following goal is equivalent:
        design a polynomial-time and monotone allocation rule that comes as close as possible to maximizing
        the social surplus.

        There are a number of heuristics for the knapsack problem that have good worst-case performance
        guarantees. For example, consider the following allocation rule \(\bx^G\), which given bids \(\bb\)
        chooses a feasible set - a set \(S\) of winners with total size \(\sum_{i\in S}w_i\) at most the
        capacity \(W\). We assume, without loss of generality, that \(w_i\le W\) for every \(i\)
        1. Sort and re-index the bidders so that
           \begin{equation*}
           \frac{b_1}{w_1}\ge\frac{b_2}{w_2}\ge\dots\ge\frac{b_n}{w_n}
           \end{equation*}
        2. Pick winners in this order until one doesn't fit, and then halt
        3. Return either the step-2 solution, or the highest bidder, whichever create more surplus.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        Assuming truthful bids, the surplus of the greedy allocation rule is at least 50% of the
        maximum-possible surplus.
        #+END_theorem

        #+BEGIN_proof
        Consider truthful bids \(v_1,\dots,v_n\), known sizes \(w_1,\dots,w_n\), and a capacity \(W\). Suppose
        we relax the problem so that a bidder can be chosen /fractionally/, with its value pro-rated
        accordingly. For example, if 70% of a bidder with value 10 is chosen, then it contributes 7 to the
        surplus.

        Suppose in the optimal fractional solution, the first \(k\) bidders in the sorted order win and the
        \((k+1)\)th bidder fractionally wins. The surplus achieved by steps (1) and (2) in the greedy
        allocation rule is exactly the total value of the first \(k\) bidders. The surplus achieved in step
        (3) in the greedy allocation rule is at least the total value of the \((k + 1)\)th bidder. The better
        of these two solutions is at least half of the surplus of the optimal fractional solution, which is at
        least the surplus of an optimal (non-fractional) solution to the original problem.
        #+END_proof

        The greedy allocation rule is even better under additional assumptions. For example, if
        \(w_i\le\alpha W\) for every bidder \(i\), with \(\alpha\in(0,0.5]\), then the approximation guarantee
        improves to \(1-\alpha\), even if the third step of the algorithm is omitted.

        For greedy allocation rule, we still have monotonicity.

        Natural allocation rules are not always monotone. For example, for every \(\epsilon>0\), there is a
        \((1-\epsilon)\)-approximation algorithm for the Knapsack problem that runs in time polynomial in the
        input and \(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\) - a  “fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS)”. The rule
        induced by the standard implementation of this algorithm is not monotone, although it can be tweaked
        to restore monotonicity without degrading the approximation guarantee (see the Problems for details).
        This is characteristic of work in algorithmic mechanism design: consider an NP hard optimization
        problem, check if the state-of-the-art approximation algorithm directly leads to a DSIC mechanism and,
        if not, tweak it or design a new approximation algorithm that does, hopefully without degrading the
        approximation guarantee.
** The Revelation Principle
        Can non-DSIC mechanisms accomplish things that DSIC mechanisms cannot? Let's tease apart two separate
        assumptions that are conflated in our DSIC definition:
        1. Every participant in the mechanism has a dominant strategy, no matter what its private valuation is.
        2. This dominant strategy is *direct revalation*, where the participant truthfully reports all of its
           private information to the mechanism.

        There are mechanisms that satisfy (1) but not (2). To give a silly example, imagine a single-item
        auction in which the seller, given bids \(\bb\), runs a Vickrey auction on the bids \(2\bb\). Every
        bidder’s dominant strategy is then to bid half its value.

        Suppose we relax condition (1). The drawback is that we then need stronger assumptions to predict the
        behavior of participants and the mechanism’s outcome.


        The Revelation Principle states that, given requirement (1) in Section 3.1, there is no need to relax requirement (2): it comes “for free.”
        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Revelation Principle]
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        For every mechanism \(M\) in which every participant has a dominant strategy, there is an equivalent
        direct-revelation DSIC mechanism \(M'\).
        #+END_theorem

        #+BEGIN_proof
        By assumption, for every participant \(i\) and private information \(v_i\) that \(i\) might have,
        \(i\) has a dominant strategy \(s_i(v_i)\) in the given mechanism \(M\).

        Construct the following mechanism \(M'\), to which participants delegate the responsibility of playing
        the appropriate dominant strategy. Precisely, (direct-revelation) mechanism \(M'\) accepts sealed bids
        \(b_1,\dots,b_n\) from the players. It submits the bids \(s_1(b_1),\dots,s_n(b_n)\) to the mechanism
        \(M\), and chooses the same outcome that \(M\) does.

        Mechanism \(M'\) is DSIC: If a participant \(i\) has private information \(v_i\), then submitting a
        bid other than \(v_i\) can only result in \(M'\) playing a strategy other than \(s_i(v_i)\) in \(M\),
        which can only decrease \(i\)'s utility.

* Revenue-Maximizing Auctions
** The Challenge of Revenue Maximization
        Use Beyasian analysis here. Our model:
        * A single-parameter environment
        * The private valuation \(v_i\) of participant \(i\) is assumed to be drawn from a distribution
          \(F_i\) with density function \(f_i\) with support contained in \([0,v_{\max}]\) (Recall \(F_i(z)\)
          denotes the probability that a random variable drawn from \(F_i\) has value at most \(z\)). We
          assume that the distributions \(F_1,\dots,F_n\) are independent
        * The distributions \(F_1,\dots,F_n\) are known in advance to the mechanism designer. The realizations
          \(v_1,\dots,v_n\) of bidders' valuation are private.
        In a Bayesian environment, the optimal action among, all DSIC auctions, has the highest expected
        revenue, where the expectation is w.r.t. the given distribution \(F_1\times\dots F_n\) over valuation
        profiles \(\bv\).

        The expected revenue of a posted price \(r\) is
        \begin{equation*}
        r\cdot(1-F(r))
        \end{equation*}
        #+LATEX: \wu{
        Note that \(F(r)\) is the probability when player bids less than \(r\). Then \(1-F(r)\) is the
        probability of selling out.
        #+LATEX: }
        Given a distribution \(F\), the optimal posted price is called the *monopoly price* of the distribution
        \(F\). Since DSIC mechanisms are posted prices, posting the monopoly price is the revenue-maximizing
        auction.

        Consider a single-item auction with two bidders with valuations drawn i.i.d. from the uniform
        distribution on \([0, 1]\). We could of course run the Vickrey auction; its revenue is the expected
        value of the smaller bid, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\)
        #+LATEX: \wu{
        Let \(Y\) be the second-highest bid. Then
        \begin{equation*}
        F_Y(y)=P(x_1\le y\wedge x_2\le y)=y^2
        \end{equation*}
        Therefore
        \begin{equation*}
        f_Y(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_Y(y)=2y
        \end{equation*}
        Hence
        \begin{equation*}
        E[Y]=\int_0^1y\cdot f_Y(y)dy=\int_0^12y^2dy=\frac{2}{3}
        \end{equation*}

        Another way: Maximizing \(r\cdot(1-F(r))^2=r(1-r)^2=r^3-2r^2+r\). Then \(r=\frac{1}{3}\)
        #+LATEX: }

        We could also supplement the Vickrey auction with a *reserve price*. In a Vickrey auction with reserve
        \(r\), the allocation rule awards the item to the highest bidder, unless all bids are less than \(r\).
        The corresponding payment rule charges the winner the second-highest bid or \(r\), whichever is
        larger.

** Expected Revenue Equals Expected Virtual Welfare

        Our goal is to characterize the optimal DSIC auction for every single-parameter environment and
        distributions \(F_1,\dots,F_n\).

        By the Revelation Principle, every DSIC auction is equivalent to a direct-revelation DSIC
        mechanism \((\bx,\bp)\). We can therefore only direct-revelation mechanisms from here on. We
        correspondingly assume truthful bids (\(\bb=\bv\)) for the rest of chapter

        The expected revenue of an auction \((\bx,\bp)\) is
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{\bv}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n\bp(\bv) \right]
        \end{equation*}

        where the expectation is w.r.t. the distribution \(F_1\times\dots\times F_n\) over bidders' valuations.
        In this section, we derive a /second/ formula for the expected revenue of an auction.

        Recall Myerson's payment formula
        \begin{equation*}
        p_i(b_i,\bb_{-i})=\int_0^{b_i}z\cdot x_i'(z,\bb_{-i})dz
        \end{equation*}

        *Step 1*: Fix \(i\) and \(\bv_{-i}\). By Myerson's payment formula,
        \begin{align*}
        \bE_{v_i\sim F_i}[p_i(\bv)]&=\int_0^{v_{\max}}p_i(\bv)f_i(v_i)dv_i=
        \int_0^{v_{\max}}\left[\int_0^{v_i}z\cdot x_i'(z,\bb_{-i})dz \right]f_i(v_i)dv_i\\
        &=\int_0^{v_{\max}}\left[ \int_z^{v_{\max}}f_i(v_i)dv_i \right]z\cdot x_i'(z,\bb_{-i})dz\\
        &=\int_0^{v_{\max}}\underbrace{(1-F_i(z))\cdot z}_{f}\cdot \underbrace{x_i'(z,\bb_{-i})}_{g'}dz\\
        &=\underbrace{(1-F_i(z))\cdot z\cdot x_i(z,\bv_{-i})|_0^{v_{\max}}}_{=0-0}-\int_0^{v_{\max}}x_i(z,\bv_{-i})\cdot(1-F_i(z)-zf_i(z))dz\\
        &=\int_0^{v_{\max}}\underbrace{\left(z-\frac{1-F_i(z)}{f_i(z)} \right)}_{:=\varphi_i(z)}x_i(z,\bv_{-i})f_i(z)dz
        \end{align*}

        The *virtual valuation* \(\varphi_i(v_i)\) of bidder \(i\) with valuation \(v_i\) drawn from \(F_i\) is
        \begin{equation*}
        \varphi_i(v_i)=v_i-\frac{1-F_i(v_i)}{f_i(v_i)}
        \end{equation*}

        Therefore
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{v_i\sim F_i}[p_i(\bv)]=\bE_{v_i\sim F_i}[\varphi_i(v_i)\cdot x_i(\bv)]
        \end{equation*}

        Then
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{\bv}[p_i(\bv)]=\bE_{\bv}[\varphi_i(v_i)\cdot x_i(\bv)]\\
        \end{equation*}
        and
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{\bv}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^np_i(\bv) \right]=\sum_{i=1}^n\bE_{\bv}[p_i(\bv)]=
        \sum_{i=1}^n\bE_{\bv}[\varphi_i(v_i)\cdot x_i(\bv)]=\bE_{\bv}
        \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)\cdot x_i(\bv) \right]
        \end{equation*}

        Thus,
        \begin{equation}
        \label{welfare}
        \text{EXPECTED REVENUE} =\text{EXPECTED VIRTUAL WELFARE}
        \end{equation}

** Bayesian Optimal Auctions
        Equation [[eqref:welfare]] says that even though we only care about payments, we can focus on an
        optimization problem that concerns only the mechanism’s allocation rule.

*** Maximizing Expected Virtual Welfare
        Let's assume:
        1. A single-item auction
        2. bidders are i.i.d.

        We maximize [[eqref:welfare]] pointwise: for each input \(\bv\), we choose \(\bx(\bv)\) to maximize the
        virtual welfare \(\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)x_i(\bv)\) obtained on the input \(\bv\) subject to
        feasibility of \((x_1,\dots,x_n)\in X\). We call this the *virtual welfare-maximizing allocation rule*

        In a single-item auction, where the feasibility constraint is \(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i(\bv)\le 1\) for each
        \(\bv\), the virtual welfare-maximizing rule just awards the item to the bidder with the highest
        virtual valuation. Recall that virtual valuations can be negative (e.g., \(\varphi_i(v_i)=2v_i-1\)
        when \(v_i\)is uniform between 0 and 1), and if every bidder has a negative virtual valuation then the
        virtual welfare is maximized by not awarding the item to anyone.

        Choosing \(\bx(\bv)\) separately for each \(\bv\) to maximize \(\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)x_i(\bv)\)
        defines an allocation rule that maximizes the expected virtual welfare eqref:welfare over all
        allocation rules. The question is: /is this virtual welfare-maximizing rule monotone/?

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
        #+BEGIN_definition
        A distribution \(F\) is *regular* if the corresponding virtual valuation function
        \(v-\frac{1-F(v)}{f(v)}\) is strictly increasing.
        #+END_definition

        Assume now that the valuation distribution is regular. The virtual-welfare maximizing allocation rule,
        which allocates to the bidder with highest nonnegative virtual valuation (if any), is monotone and
        yields the optimal auction. This allocation rule is thus equivalent to the Vickrey auction with a
        reserve price of \(\varphi^{-1}(0)\). Thus, for i.i.d. bidders and a regular valuation distribution,
        eBay (with a suitable opening bid) is the optimal auction format!

        More generally, consider an arbitrary single-parameter environment and valuation distributions
        \(F_1,\dots,F_n\). The virtual welfare-maximizing allocation rule is now defined as that  which, for
        each input v, chooses the feasible allocation that maximizes the virtual welfare
        \(\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)x_i(\bv)\).  If every distribution \(F_i\) is regular, then this allocation rule is monotone.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
        #+BEGIN_proposition
        If each \(F_i\) is regular, then each \(x_i(\cdot,\bv_{-j})\) is monotone.
        #+END_proposition


* Simple Near-Optimal Auctions
        For every DSIC auction \((\bx,\bp)\) for a single-parameter environment with valuation distributions
        \(F_1,\dots,F_n\), the expected revenue equals the expected virtual welfare:
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{\bv}\left[\sum_{i=1}^np_i(\bv)\right]=\bE_{\bv}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)\cdot x_i(\bv)\right]
        \end{equation*}
        Define the virtual welfare-maximizing allocation rule as the one that sets
        \begin{equation*}
        \bx(\bv):=\argmax_{X}\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)x_i(\bv)a
        \end{equation*}
        for each input \(\bv\). If every \(F_i\) is regular, then the virtual welfare-maximizing allocation
        rule is monotone and, after we define suitable payments, maximizes expected revenue over all DSIC
        auctions. This characterization of optimal auctions can be extended to irregular distributions

** The Prophet Inequality
        Consider the following game, which has \(n\) stages. In stage \(i\), you are offered a nonnegative
        prize \(\pi_i\), drawn from a distribution \(G_i\). You are told the distributions \(G_1,\dots,G_n\)
        in advance, and these distributions are independent. You are told the realization \(\pi_i\) only at
        stage \(i\). After seeing \(\pi_i\), you can either accept the rpize and end the game, or discard the
        prize and proceed to the next stage.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Prophet Inequality]
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        For every sequence \(G_1,\dots,G_n\) of independent distributions, there is strategy that guarantees
        expected reward \(\frac{1}{2}\bE_\pi[\max_i\pi_i]\). In fact, there is such a *threshold strategy*
        \(t\), which accepts prize \(i\) iff \(\pi_i\ge t\)
        #+END_theorem

        #+BEGIN_proof
        Let \(z^+\) denote \(\max\{z,0\}\). Consider a threshold strategy with threshold \(t\). Let \(q(t)\)
        denote the probability that the threshold strategy accepts no prize at all. As \(t\) increases, the
        risk \(q(t)\) increases but the average value of an accepted prize goes up.

        If exactly one prize \(i\) satisfies \(\pi_i\ge t\), then we should get "extra credit" of \(\pi_i-t\).
        If at least two prizes exceed the threshold, say \(i\) and \(j\), then our "extra credit" is either
        \(v_i-t\) or \(v_j-t\) depending on which of \(i,j\) belongs to the earlier stage. Let's be lazy and
        punt on this complication: when two or more prizes exceed the threshold, we'll only credit the
        baseline \(t\) to the strategy's payoff.

        Formally, we have the following lower bound:
        \begin{align*}
        &\bE[\text{payoff of $t$-threshold strategy}]\\
        &\ge(1-q(t))\cdot t+\sum_{i=1}^n\bE[\pi_i-t\mid\pi_i\ge t,\pi_j<t\forall j\neq i]\Pr[\pi_i\ge t]\cdot\Pr[\pi_j<t\forall j\neq i]\\
        &=(1-q(t))\cdot t+\sum_{i=1}^n\underbrace{\bE[\pi_i-t\mid\pi_i\ge t]\Pr[\pi_i\ge t]}_{=\bE[(\pi_i-t)^+]}\cdot
        \underbrace{\Pr[\pi_j<t\forall j\neq i]}_{\ge q(t)}\\
        &\ge(1-q(t))\cdot t+q(t)\sum_{i=1}^n\bE[(\pi_i-t)^+]
        \end{align*}

        But
        \begin{align*}
        \bE[\max_i\pi_i]&=\bE[t+\max_i(\pi_i-t)]\\
        &\le t+\bE[\max_i(\pi_i-t)^+]\\
        &\le t+\sum_{i=1}^n\bE[(\pi_i-t)^+]
        \end{align*}
        Therefore we can set \(q(t)=0.5\) and complete the proof.
        #+END_proof
** Simple Single-Item Auctions
        Now we return to our motivating example of a single-item auction with \(n\) bidders with valuations
        drawn from regular distribution \(F_1,\dots,F_n\). We use the Prophet Inequality to design a
        relatively simple, near-optimal auction.

        The key idea is to regard the virtual valuation \(\varphi_i(v_i)^+\) of a bidder, if nonnegative, as
        the \(i\)th prize. Note that the expected revenue of the optimal auction is
        \(\bE_{\bv}[\sum_i\varphi_i(v_i)x_i(\bv)]=\bE_{\bv}[\max_i\varphi_i(v_i)^+]\).

        Now we consider any allocation rule that has the following form:
        1. Choose \(t\) s.t. \(\Pr[\max_i\varphi_i(v_i)^+\ge t]=0.5\)
        2. Give the item to a bidder \(i\) with \(\varphi_i(v_i)\ge t\), if any, breaking ties among multiple
           candidate winners arbitrarily.

        The strong form of the Prophet Inequality immediately implies that every auction with an allocation
        rule of the above type satisfies
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{\bv}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i(v_i)^+x_i\bv\right]\ge\frac{1}{2}
        \bE_{\bv}\left[\max_i\varphi_i(v_i)^+\right]
        \end{equation*}

        For example, here is a specific such allocation rule:
        1. Set a reserve price \(r_i=\varphi_i^{-1}(t)\) for each bidder \(i\), with \(t\) defined as above
        2. Give the item to the highest bidder that meets its reserve
** Prior-Independent Auctions and the Bulow-Klemperer Theorem
        This section explores a different critique of the optimal auction approach developed last lecture: the
        valuation distributions \(F_1,\dots,F_n\) were assumed to be known to the seller \(i\)  advance.

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Bulow-Klemperer]
        #+BEGIN_theorem
        Let \(F\) be a regular distribution and \(n\) a positive integer. Then
        \begin{equation*}
        \bE_{v_1,\dots,v_{n+1}\sim F}[\text{Rev}(\text{VA})(n+1\text{ bidders})]\ge\bE_{v_1,\dots,v_n\sim F}[\text{Rev}(\text{OPT}_F)(n\text{ bidders})]
        \end{equation*}
        where \(\text{VA}\) and \(\text{OPT}_F\) denote the Vickrey auction and the optimal auction for \(F\), respectively
        #+END_theorem

        #+BEGIN_proof
        Define a fictitious auction \(\cala\) to facilitate the comparison. This auction operates in the
        environment with \(n+1\) bidders, as follows:
        1. Simulate the optimal auction \(\text{OPT}_F\) on the first \(n\) bidders \(1,2,\dots,n\)
        2. If the item was not awarded in step 1, then give the item to bidder \(n+1\) for free
        We defined \(\cala\) to possess two properties useful for the analysis. First, its expected revenue
        (with \(n+1\) bidders) is exactly that of \(\text{OPT}_F\) (with \(n\) bidders). Second, \(\cala\)
        always allocates the item.

        We can finish the proof by arguing that, for i.i.d. regular bidder valuations, the Vickrey auction
        maximizes expected revenue over all auctions that are guaranteed to allocate the item. By the
        equivalence of expected revenue and expected virtual welfare, the optimal auction that always
        allocates the item awards the item to the bidder with the highest virtual valuation (even if this is
        negative). The Vickrey auction awards the item to the bidder with the highest valuation. Since
        bidders’ valuations are i.i.d. draws from a regular distribution, all bidders share the same
        increasing virtual valuation function \(\varphi\). Thus the bidder with the highest virtual valuation
        is always the bidder with the highest valuation. We conclude that the Vickrey auction (with \(n+1\)
        bidders) has expected revenue at least that of every auction that always allocates the item, including
        \(\cala\), and therefore its expected revenue is at least that of \(\text{OPT}_F\) (with \(n\)
        bidders).

        First we argue that optimal auction that always sells the item is the Vickrey auction.

        \begin{align*}
        \bE_{v_1,\dots,v_{n+1}\sim F}[\text{Rev}(\text{VA})(n+1\text{ bidders})]&=
        \text{optimal single-item auction for $n+1$ bidders that always sells the item}\\
        &\ge \cala \\
        &\ge\bE_{v_1,\dots,v_n\sim F}[\text{Rev}(\text{OPT}_F)(n\text{ bidders})]
        \end{align*}
