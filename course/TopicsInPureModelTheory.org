NEED TO FINISH BASIC MODEL THEORY FIRST
* Introduction
    "Classification theory", also known as "pure model theory"

    study of first order theories, usually complete, in terms of invariants, divide lines,
    hierarchies, complexity

    Invariants, up to bi-interpretability. Some properties are rather of a sort, e.g. strong
    minimality

    "Applied model theory" the study of specific first order theories, such as abelian groups, DCF0,
    ZFC, possibly informed by "classification theory"

    In 50s, basic distinction: decidable vs undecidable

    later on, quantifier elimination (language dependent), model companion, generic structures
    (Tarski, Robinson)

    Recently re-energized - "generic structures" woodin constructions

    60s-70s model theory as an appendex to set theory (like recursion theory)

    Key move: following Morley - Shelah's program to classify theories \(T\) according to whether
    the model of \(T\) can be classified by some generalized cardinal invariants -> stability

    stability, few stable theories

    o-minimality

    10-15 years later, the techniques of stability (forking) seems to be relevent to unstable
    settings

    simple, NIP, NSOP

* Basic Notions
    Intereted in mainly complete first order theories \(T\), often work in a saturated
    model \(\barM\) of \(T\), e.g., \kappa-saturated for cardinal \kappa, BIG \kappa

    \kappa-saturated, strongly \kappa-homogeneous

    models of \(T\) of cardinality \(\le\kappa\) are elementary substructures of \(\barM\)

    Category \(\Mod(T)\) categories of models of \(T\) and elementary maps

    \(\Def(T)\) - objects: \(\varphi(\barx)\) \(L\)-formula up to equivalence mod \(T\)
    morphisms: \(\varphi(\barx)\) to \(\psi(\bary)\) given by \(\chi(\barx,\bary)\in L\) defining a
    function \(\varphi(M)\) to \(\psi(M)\) for any \(M\vDash T\)

    interested in \(T\) up to biinterpretability

    Bi-interpretability
