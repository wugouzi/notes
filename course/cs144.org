* TCP lab
** Receiver
    TCP is a protocol that reliably conveys a pair of flow-controlled byte streams (one in each
    direction) over unreliable datagrams. Two parties participate in the TCP connection, and
    *each party* acts as both “sender” (of its own outgoing byte-stream) and “receiver” (of an
    incoming byte-stream) at the same time. The two parties are called the “endpoints” of the
    connection, or the “peers.”
