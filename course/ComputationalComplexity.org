    A TM \(M\) is described by a tuple \((\Gamma,Q,\delta)\) containing
    * A finite set \Gamma of the symbols that \(M\)'s tapes can contain. We assume that \Gamma contains a
      designated "blank" symbol, denoted \(\Box\); a designated "start" symbol, denoted \(\rhd\);
      and the numbers 0 and 1. We call \Gamma the *alphabet* of \(M\)
    * A finite set \(Q\) of possible states \(M\)' register can be in. We assume that \(Q\) contains
      a designated start state, denoted \(q_{\start}\), and a designated halting state, denoted \(q_{\halt}\)
    * A function \(\delta:Q\times\Gamma^k\to Q\times\Gamma^{k-1}\times\{\text{L,S,R}\}^k\),
      where \(k\ge2\), describing the rules \(M\) use in performing each step. This function is
      called the *transition function* of \(M\)

    #+BEGIN_definition
    Let \(f:\{0,1\}^*\to\{0,1\}\) and let \(T:\N\to\N\) be some functions, and let \(M\) be a Turing
    machine. We say that \(M\) *computes* \(f\) if for every \(x\in\{0,1\}^*\), whenever \(M\) is
    initialized to the start configuration on input \(x\), then it halts with \(f(x)\) written on
    its output tape. We say \(M\) *computes \(f\) in \(T(n)\)-time* if its computation on every
    input \(x\) requires at most \(T(\abs{x})\) steps
    #+END_definition

    A function \(T:\N\to\N\) is *time constructible* if \(T(n)\ge n\) and there is a TM \(M\) that
    computes the function \(x\mapsto\lcorner{T(\abs{x})}\) in time \(T(n)\). (\(\lcorner{T(\abs{x})}\)
    denotes the binary representation of the number \(T(\abs{x})\)). The restriction \(T(n)\ge n\) is
    to allow the algorithm time to read its input.

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_proposition
    For every \(f:\{0,1\}^*\to\{0,1\}\) and a time-constructible b\(T:\N\to\N\), if \(f\) is
    computable in time \(T(n)\) by a TM \(M\) using alphabet \Gamma, then it's computable in time
    \(4\log\abs{\Gamma}T(n)\) by a TM \(M\) using the alphabet \(\{0,1,\Box,\rhd\}\).
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    Let \(M\) be a TM with alphabet \Gamma, \(k\) tapes and state set \(Q\) that computes the
    function \(f\) in \(T(n)\) times. We describe an equivalent TM \(\tilde{M}\) computing \(f\)
    with alphabet \(\{0,1,\Box,\rhd\}\), \(k\) tapes and a set \(Q'\) of states.

    One can encode any member of \Gamma using \(\log\abs{\Gamma}\) bits. Thus each of \(\tilde{M}\)'s work
    tapes will simply encode one of \(M\)'s tapes: For every cell in \(M\)'s tape we will
    have \(\log\abs{\Gamma}\) cells in the corresponding tape of \(\tilde{M}\)

    To simulate one step of \(M\), the machine \(\tilde{M}\) will 1. use \(\log\abs{\Gamma}\) steps to
    read from each tape the \(\log\abs{\Gamma}\) bits encoding of a symbol of \Gamma 2. use its state register
    to store the symbols read 3. use \(M\)'s transition function to compute the symbols \(M\) writes
    and \(M\)'s new state given this information 4. store this information in its state register 5.
    use \(\log\abs{\Gamma}\) steps to write the encodings of these symbols on its tapes

    label:prop1.6
    Define a single-tape Turing machine to be a TM that has only one read-write tape. For every
    \(f:\{0,1\}^*\to\{0,1\}\) and time-constructible \(T:\N\to\N\) if \(f\) is computable in
    time \(T(n)\) by a TM \(M\) using \(k\) tapes, then it is computable in time \(5kT(n)^2\) by a
    single-tape TM \(M\)
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    The TM \(\tilde{M}\) encodes \(k\) tapes of \(M\) on a single tape by using
    locations \(1,k+1,2k+1,\dots\) to encode the first tape, locations \(2,k+2,2k+2,\dots\) to
    encode the second tape etc. For every symbol \(a\) in \(M\)'s alphabet, \(\tilde{M}\) will
    contain both the symbol \(a\) and the symbol \(\hat{a}\). In the encoding of each tape, exactly
    one symbol will be of the "^ type", indicating that the corresponding head of \(M\) is
    positioned in that location. \(\tilde{M}\) will not touch the first \(n+1\) locations of its
    tape (where the input is located) but rather start by taking \(O(n^2)\) steps to copy the input
    bit by bit into the rest of the tape, while encoding it in the above way.
    #+END_proof

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Oblivious Turing machines]
    #+BEGIN_remark
    One can ensure that the proof of Proposition ref:prop1.6 yields a TM \(\tilde{M}\) with the
    following property: its head movements do not depend on the input but only depend on the input
    length. That is, every input \(x\in\{0,1\}^*\) and \(i\in\N\), the location of each of \(M\)'s
    at the \(i\)th step of execution on input \(x\) is only a function of \(\abs{x}\) and \(i\). A
    machine with this property is called *oblivious*.

     By representing the possible invitees to a dinner party with the vertices of a graph having an
     edge between any two people who don't get along. The dinner party computational problem becomes
     the problem of finding a maximum sized *independent set* (set of vertices without any common
     edges) in a given graph. The corresponding language is
     \begin{equation*}
\INDSET=\{\la G,k\ra:\exists S\subseteq V(G)\text{ s.t. }\abs{S}\ge k\text{ and }\forall u,v\in S, \ove{uv}\not\in E(G)\}

     Consider the following polynomial-time algorithm \(M\): Given a pair \(\la G,k\ra\) and a
     string \(u\in\{0,1\}^*\), output 1 iff \(u\) encodes a list of \(k\) vertices of \(G\) s.t.
     there is no edge between any two members of the list. Note that if \(n\) is the number of
     vertices in \(G\), then a list of \(k\) vertices can be encoded using \(O(k\log n)\) bits,
     where \(n\) is the number of vertices in \(G\). Thus \(u\) is a string of at

     The main idea is that the sequence of nondeterministic choices made by an accepting computation
     of an NDTM can be viewedas a certificate that the input is in the language, and vice versa

     Suppose \(p:\N\to\N\) is a polynomial and \(L\) is decidable by a NDTM \(N\) that runs in
     time \(p(n)\). For every \(x\in L\), there is a sequence of nondeterministic choices that
     makes \(N\) reach \(q_{\accept}\) on input \(x\). We can use this sequence as a certificate
     for \(x\). This certificate has length \(p(\abs{x})\) and can be verified in polynomial time by
     a deterministic machine.

     Conversely, if \(L\in\NP\), then we describe a polynomial time NDTM \(N\) that decides \(L\).
     On input \(x\), it uses the ability to make nondeterministic choices to write down a
     string \(u\) of length \(p(\abs{x})\). (Having transition \(\delta_0\) correspond to writing a
     0 and \(\delta_1\) ). Then it runs the deterministic verifier

     #+END_lemma

     #+BEGIN_proof
     Let \(L\) be an \(\NP\) language. By definition, there is a polynomial time TM \(M\) s.t. for
     every \(x\in\{0,1\}^*\), \(x\in L\Leftrightarrow M(x,u)=1\) for
     some \(u\in\{0,1\}^{p(\abs{x})}\), where \(p:\N\to\N\) is some polynomial. We show \(L\) is
     polynomial-time Karp reducible to \(\SAT\) by describing a polynomial-time
     transformation \(x\to\varphi_x\) from strings to CNF formulae s.t. \(x\in L\) iff \(\varphi_x\)
     is satisfiable. Equivalently
     \begin{equation*}
\varphi_x\in\SAT \quad\text{ iff }\quad\exists u\in\{0,1\}^{p(\abs{x})}
\text{ s.t. }M(x\circ u)=1
     \end{equation*}
     where \(\circ\) denotes concatenation

     Assume \(M\)
     1. \(M\) only has two tapes - an input tape and a work/output tape
     2. \(M\) is an oblivious TM in the sense that its head movement does not depend on the contents
        of its tapes. That is, \(M\)'s computation takes the same time for all inputs of size \(n\),
        and for every \(i\) the location of \(M\)'s head at the \(i\)th step depends only on \(i\)
        and the length of the input


     We can make these assumptions without loss of generality because for every \(T(n)\)-time TM \(M\)
     there exists a two-tape oblivious TM \(\tilde{M}\) computing the same function
     in \(O(T(n)^2)\). Thus in particular, if \(L\in\NP\), then there exists a two-tape oblivious
     polynomial-time TM \(M\) and a polynomial \(p\) s.t.
     \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:2.2}
x\in L \Leftrightarrow \exists u\in\{0,1\}^{p(\abs{x})}\text{ s.t. }M(x\circ u)=1
     \end{equation}

     Note that because \(M\) is oblivious, we can run it on the trivial input \((x,0^{p(\abs{x})})\)
     to determine the precise head position of \(M\) during its computation on every other input of
     the same length.

     Denote by \(Q\) the set of \(M\)'s possible states and by \Gamma its alphabet. The *snapshot*
     of \(M\)'s execution on some input \(y\) at a particular step \(i\) is the triple
     \(\la a,b,q\ra\in\Gamma\times\Gamma\times Q\) s.t. \(a,b\) are the symbols read by \(M\)'s
     heads from the two tapes and \(q\) is the state \(M\) is in at the \(i\)th step. Clearly the
     snapshot can be encoded as a binary string. Let \(c\) denote the length of this string, which
     is some constant depending upon \(\abs{Q}\) and \(\abs{\Gamma}\)

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .5\textwidth :float H
     [[/Users/wu/notes/images/ComputationalComplexity/4.png]]

     For every \(y\in\{0,1\}^*\), the snapshot of \(M\)'s execution on input \(y\) at the \(i\)th
     step depends on its state in the \((i-1)\)st step and the contents of the current cells of its
     input and work tapes.

     Suppose somebody were to claim the existence of some \(u\) satisfying \(M(x\circ u)=1\) and as
     evidence, present you with the sequence of snapshots that arise from \(M\)'s execution
     on \(x\circ u\). How can you tell that the snapshots present a valid computation that was
     actually performed by \(M\).

     Clearly, it suffices to check that for each \(i\le T(n)\), the snapshot \(z_i\) is correct
     given the snapshot for the previous \(i-1\) steps. However, since the TM can only read/modify
     one bit at a time, to check the correctness of \(z_i\) it suffices to look at only /two/ of the
     previous snapshots. Specifically, to check \(z_i\) we need to only look at the following:
     \(z_{i-1}\), \(y_{\text{inputpos}(i)}\), \(z_{\text{prev}(i)}\). 

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .8\textwidth :float H
     [[../images/ComputationalComplexity/5.png]]

     Here \(y\) is a shorthand
     for \(x\circ u\). \(\text{inputpos}(i)\) denotes the location of \(M\)'s input tape head at
     the \(i\)th step. \(\text{prev}(i)\) is the last step before \(i\) when \(M\)'s head was in the
     same cell on its work tape that it is during step \(i\). The reason this small amount of
     information suffices to check the correctness of \(z_i\) is that the contents of the current
     cell have not been affected between step \(\text{prev}(i)\) and step \(i\).

     Since \(M\) is a deterministic TM, for every triple of values
     to \(z_{i-1},y_{\text{inputpos}(i)}\), \(z_{\text{prev}(i)}\), there is at most one value
     of \(z_i\) that is correct. Thus there is some function \(F\) that maps \(\{0,1\}^{2c+1}\)
     to \(\{0,1\}^c\) s.t. a correct \(z_i\) satisfies
     \begin{equation*}
z_i=F(z_{i-1},z_{\text{prev}(i)},y_{\text{inputpos}(i)})
     \end{equation*}

     Because \(M\) is oblivious, the values \(\text{inputpos}(i)\) and \(\text{prev}(i)\) do not
     depend on the particular input \(i\). These indices can be computed in polynomial-time by
     simulating \(M\) on a trivial input.

     By eqref:eq:2.2 , \(x\in\{0,1\}^{n}\in L\) iff \(M(x\circ u)=1\) for
     some \(u\in\{0,1\}^{p(n)}\). The previous discussion shows this latter condition occurs iff
     there exists a string \(y\in\{0,1\}^{n+p(n)}\) and a sequence of strings
     \(z_1,\dots,z_{T(n)}\in\{0,1\}^c\) (where \(T(n)\) is the number of steps \(M\) takes on inputs
     of length \(n+p(n)\)) satisfying the following four conditions
     1. The first \(n\) bits of \(y\) are equal to \(x\)
     2. The string \(z_1\) encodes the initial snapshot of \(M\). That is, \(z_1\) encodes the
        triple \(\la\rhd,\Box,q_{\start}\ra\).
     3. For every \(i\in\{2,\dots,T(n)\}\), \(z_i=F(z_{i-1},z_{\text{prev}(i)},y_{\text{inputpos}(i)})\).
     4. The last string \(z_{T(n)}\) encodes a snapshot where the machine halts and outputs 1


     The formula \(\varphi_x\) will take variables \(y\in\{0,1\}^{n+p(n)}\)
     and \(z\in\{0,1\}^{cT(n)}\) and will verify that \(y,z\) satisfy the AND of these four
     conditions. Thus \(x\in L\Leftrightarrow\varphi_x\in\SAT\).

     Condition 1 can be expressed as a CNF formula of size \(4n\) . Conditions 2 and 4 each depend
     on \(c\) variables and hence by Proposition ref:lemma2.13 can be expressed by CNF formulae of
     size \(c2^c\). Condition 3, which is an AND of \(T(n)\) conditions each  depending on at most \(3c+1\)
     variables, can be expressedas a CNF formula of size at most \(T(n)(3c+1)2^{3c+1}\). Hence the AND of all
     these conditions can be expressed as a CNF formula of size d(n + T(n)) where d is some constant
     depending only on \(M\). Moreover, this CNF formula can be computedin time polynomial in the running
     time of \(M\).

     for \(x\).
     #+END_theorem

     #+BEGIN_proof
     We need to show that if \(\bP=\NP\) then for every polynomial-time TM \(M\) and
     polynomial \(p(n)\), there is a polynomial-time TM \(B\) with the following property: for every
     \(x\in\{0,1\}^n\) if there is \(u\in\{0,1\}^{p(n)}\) s.t. \(M(x,u)=1\) then \(\abs{B(x)}=p(n)\)
     and \(M(x,B(x))=1\)

     We start by showing the theorem for the case of \(\SAT\). In particular, we show that given an
     algorithm \(A\) that decides \(\SAT\), we can come up an algorithm \(B\) that on input a
     satisfiable CNF formula \varphi with \(n\) variables, finds a satisfying assignment for \varphi
     using \(2n+1\) calls to \(A\) and some additional polynomial-time computation.

     We first use \(A\) to check that the input formula is satisfiable. If so, we first
     substitute \(x_1=0\) and then \(x_1=1\) in \varphi and then use \(A\) to decide which of the two is
     satisfiable. Say the first is satisfiable. Then we fix \(x_1=0\). Continuing this way, we end
     up with an assignment

     To solve the search problem for an arbitrary \(\NP\)-language \(L\), we use the fact that the
     reduction of Theorem ref:thm2.10 from \(L\) to \(\SAT\)is actually a Levin reduction. This
     means that we have a polynomial-time computable function \(f\) s.t. we can map a satisfying
     assignment of \(f(x)\) into a certificate for \(x\).
     #+END_proof

     The theorem ref:thm2.18 shows that \(\SAT\) is *downward self-reducible*, which means that
     given an algorithm that solves \(\SAT\) on inputs of length smaller than \(n\) we can
     solve \(\SAT\) on inputs of length \(n\).

    each \(Q_i\)is one of the two quantifiers \(\forall\) or \(\exists\), \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) ranges over \(\{0,1\}\) and
    \varphi is a quantifier-free Boolean formula.

    Let \(\TQBF\) be the set of quantified Boolean formulae that are true
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

    \(\TQBF\) is \(\PSPACE\)-complete
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    First we show that \(\TQBF\in\PSPACE\). Let
    \begin{equation*}
    \psi=Q_1x_1\dots Q_nx_n\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)
    \end{equation*}
    be a quantified Boolean formula with \(n\) variables, where we denote the size of \varphi by \(m\). We
    show a recursive algorithm \(A\) that can decide the truth of \psi in \(O(n+m)\) space.

    If \(n=0\) then \varphi can be evaluated in \(O(m)\) time and space, and so we assume \(n>0\).
    For \(b\in\{0,1\}\) denote by \(\psi\restriction_{x_1=b}\) the modification of \psi where the first
    quantifier \(Q_1\) is dropped and all occurrences of \(x_1\) are replaces with the constant \(b\).
    Algorithm \(A\) will works as follows: if \(Q_1=\exists\) then output 1 iff at least one
    of \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=0})\)  and \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=1})\) outputs 1. If \(Q_1=\forall\), then
    output 1 iff both  \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=0})\)  and \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=1})\) outputs 1.

    Let \(s_{n,m}\) denote the space \(A\) uses on formula with \(n\) variables and description
    size \(m\). The crucial point is - here we use the fact that space can be *reused* - that both
    recursive computations  \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=0})\)  and \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=1})\) can run in
    the same space. Thus assuming that \(A\) uses \(O(m)\) space to
    write  \(A(\psi\restriction_{x_1=b})\) for its recursive calls, we'll get that
    \(s_{n,m}=s_{n-1,m}+O(m)\) yielding \(s_{n,m}=O(n\cdot m)\)

    We now show that \(L\le_p\TQBF\) for every \(L\in\PSPACE\). Let \(M\) be a machine that
    decides \(L\) in \(S(n)\) space and let \(x\in\{0,1\}^n\). We show how to construct a quantified
    Boolean formula of size \(O(S(n)^2)\) that is true iff \(M\) accepts \(x\). Let \(m=O(S(n))\)
    denote the number of bits needed to encode a configuration of \(M\) on length \(n\). By Claim
    ref:claim4.4 there is a Boolean formula \(\varphi_{M,x}\) s.t. for every two
    strings \(C,C'\in\{0,1\}^m\) \(\varphi_{M,x}(C,C)=1\) iff \(C\) and \(C'\) encode two adjacent
    configurations in the configuration graph \(G_{M,x}\).

    let \(\psi_i(C,C')\) be true iff there is a path of length at most \(2^i\) from \(C\) to \(C'\)
    in \(G_{M,x}\). Note that \(\psi=\psi_m\) and \(\psi_0=\varphi_{M,x}\). The crucial point is
    \(\psi_i(C,C')=\exists C''\psi_{i-1}(C,C'')\wedge\psi_{i-1}(C'',C')\)

    But \(\psi_m\) has size about \(2^m\), which is not good. Instead, we use additional quantified
    variables to save on description size
    \begin{equation*}
    \exists C''\forall D_1\forall D_2((D_1=C\wedge D_2=C'')\vee(D_1=C''\wedge D_2=C'))\to \psi_{i-1}(D_1,D_2)
    \end{equation*}
    Note that \(size(\psi_i)\le size(\psi_{i-1})+O(m)\) and hence \(size(\psi_m)\le o(m^2)\)
    #+END_proof

    Since we don't require the graph in proof of Theorem ref:thm4.13 to have out-degree one, it
    actually yields a stronger statement
    \begin{equation*}
    \TQBF\in\NPSPACE

    Let \(L\in\NSPACE(S(n))\) be a language decided by a TM \(M\) s.t. for every \(x\in\{0,1\}^n\), the

    whether \(x\in L\)is equivalent to determining whether \(C_{\accept}\) can be reached
    from \(C_{\start}\) in this graph. We describe a recursive procedure \(\text{REACH?}(u,v,i)\)
    that returns "YES" if there is a path from \(u\) to \(v\) of length at most \(2^i\) and "NO"
    otherwise.
    \begin{equation*}
    \text{REACH?}(u,v,i)=\exists w(\text{REACH?}(u,w,i-1)\vee\text{REACH?}(w,v,i-1))
    \end{equation*}
    Let \(s_{M,i}\) be the space complexity of \(\text{REACH?}(u,v,i)\),
    then \(s_{M,i}=s_{M,i-1}+O(\log M)\) (since we need to enumerate all \(w\) in TM, the space we
    need is \(O(\log M)\)) and thus
    \(s_{M,\log M}=O(\log^2 M)=O(S(n)^2)\)

    \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_{2n})\) is true

    In order for player 1 to have a *winning strategy* he must have a way to win for all possible
    sequences of moves by player 2, namely, if
    \begin{equation*}
    \exists x_1\forall x_2 \exists x_3\forall x_4\dots\forall x_{2n}\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_{2n})

    iff \(f(x)\in C\) for every \(x\in\{0,1\}^*\).

    We say that \(C\) is *\(\NL\)-complete* if it is in \(\NL\) and for every \(B\in\NL\), \(B\le_lC\)
    #+END_definition

    Another way(used by several texts) to think of logspace reductions is to imagine that the
    reduction is given
    a separate "write-once" output tape, on which it can either
    write a bit or move to the right but never move left or read the bits it wrote down
    previously.The two notions are easily proved to be equivalent (seeExercise ref:ex4.8).

    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    We prove that if \(f,g\) are two implicitly logspace computable functions, then so
    if \(h(x)=g(f(x))\). Part 2 follows by letting \(f\) be the reduction from \(B\) to \(C\)
    and \(g\) be the characteristic function of \(C\) (i.e., \(g(y)=1\) iff \(y\in C\))

    Let \(M_f,M_g\) be the logspace machines that compute the mappings \(x,i\mapsto f(x)_i\)
    and \(y,j\mapsto g(y)_i\) respectively. We construct a machine \(M_h\) that given input \(x,j\)
    with \(j\le\abs{g(f(x))}\) outputs \(g(f(x))_j\)

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .9\textwidth :float H

    \(M_h\) always maintains on its work tape the index, say \(i\), of the cell on the fictitious
    tape that \(M_g\) is currently reading, this requires only \(\log\abs{f(x)}\) space. To compute
    for one step, \(M_g\) needs to know the contents of the cell, in other words, \(f(x)|_i\). At
    this point \(M_h\) temporarily suspends its simulation of \(M_g\) (copying the contents
    of \(M_g\)'s work tape to a safe place on its own work tape) and invokes \(M_f\) on
    inputs \(x,i\) to get \(f(x)|_i\). Then it resumes its simulation of \(M_g\) using this bit. The
    total space \(M_h\) uses is
    \(O(\log\abs{g(f(x))}+s(\abs{x})+s'(\abs{f(x)}))\). Since \(\abs{f(x)}\le poly(x)\), this
    expression is \(O(\log\abs{x})\)

    #+END_definition

    This definition is an alternative definition of \(\NL\) since read-once access to bits in a
    certificate is just an alternative way to view _nondeterministic choices during a computation_

    Note that we have \(\ove{\PATH}\in\coNL\)

    \(\ove{\PATH}\in\NL\)
    #+END_theorem

    #+BEGIN_proof
    By the certificate-based definition of \(\NL\), it suffices to show an \(O(\log n)\)-space
    verification algorithm \(A\) s.t. for every \(n\)-vertex graph \(G\) and vertices \(s\)
    and \(t\), there exists a polynomial certificate \(u\) s.t. \(A(\la G,s,t\ra,u)=1\) iff \(t\) is
    not reachable from \(s\) in \(G\). Here \(A\) has only read-once access to \(u\). For
    simplicity, we identify \(G\)'s vertices with the numbers \(\{1,\dots,n\}\)

    Let \(C_i\) be the set of vertices that are reachable from \(s\) in \(G\) within at most \(i\)
    steps. For every \(i\in[n]\) and vertex \(v\), the following is a certificate that \(v\) is
    in \(C_i\): the sequence of vertices \(v_1,\dots,v_k\) along the path from \(s\) to \(v\),
    where \(k\le i\). Note that the certificate is indeed of size at most polynomial in \(n\). The
    algorithm can check the certificate using read-once access by verifying
    1. \(v_0=s\)
    2. for \(j>0\) there is an edge from \(v_{j-1}\) to \(v_j\)
    3. \(v_k=v\)
    4. the path ends within at most \(i\) steps.


    Now we use the fact that membership in \(C_i\) is certifiable to design two more types of
    certificates
    1. A certificate that a vertex \(v\) is not in \(C_i\), assuming the verifier has already been
       told the size of \(C_i\)
    2. A certificate that \(\abs{C_i}=c\) for some number \(c\), assuming the algorithm has already
       been convinced about the size of \(C_{i-1}\)


    Since \(C_0=\{s\}\), we can provide the second kind of certificate to the verifier iteratively to
    convince it of the sizes of the sets \(C_1,\dots,C_n\). Finally since \(C_n\) is just the set of all
    vertices reachable from \(s\), and the verifier has been convinced of \(\abs{C_n}\), we can use
    the first kind of certificate to convince the verifier \(t\not\in C_n\).

    Certifying that \(v\not\in C_i\) given \(\abs{C_i}\). The certificate is simply the list of
    certificates to the effects that \(u\in C_i\) for every \(u\in C_i\).

    Certifying that \(v\not\in C_i\), given \(\abs{C_{i-1}}\). like above.

    Certifying that \(\abs{C_i}=c\) given \(\abs{C_{i-1}}\).
