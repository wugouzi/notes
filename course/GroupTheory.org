* Introduction
    The group is a collection of symmetries of something.

    Axioms of a group
    1. group is a *set* with multiplication, that is, composition of symmetries, and it is associative \((ab)c=a(bc)\)
    2. identity element with trivial symmetry
    3. symmetry has inverse \(a^{-1}\)


    Goal:
    1. classify all groups up to isomorphism
    2. classify all ways a group is symmetry of something (representation theory)


    These axioms is enough to ensure that the group is a symmetry of something
* Cayley's Theorem
    Group is
    1. concrete: symmetries of object
    2. abstract: satisfying the axioms


    \(1\to 2\) is clear and Cayley's Theorem says \(2\to 1\)

    Groups \(G\) *acts* on a set \(S\): function \(G\times S\to S\) \((g,s)\mapsto g(s)\)satisfying \((gh)s=g(hs)\)
    and \(1s=s\).

    For example, if \(G\) is symmetries of octahedron (24 elements) and \(S=6\) is 6 vertices of octahedron

    if \(G\) acts on \(S=G\), then \(g(s)=gs\).

    \(G\) is a subgroup of permutations of \(S\)

    LEFT action of \(G\) on \(S\)
    \begin{equation*}
    G\times S\to S\quad g,s\to g(s)
    \end{equation*}
    RIGHT action
    \begin{equation*}
    S\times G\to S\quad s,g\to (s)g
    \end{equation*}

    is \(gs=sg\)?

    if \(G\) acts on \(S=G\) on LEFT, then this preserves the right action of \(G\), that
    is, \(g(sh)=(gs)h\)

    \(G\)=all symmetries of OBJECT (\(S=G\)) with STRUCTURE (RIGHT action of \(G\) on \(S\))

    Suppose \(f\) is a symmetry of \(S\) preserving RIGHT action. \(f(s)=f(1\cdot s)=f(1)\cdot s\). So \(f\)
    = MULT by \(f(1)\in G\)

    four actions of \(G\) on \(S=G\)
    |             | Left action  | right action |
    |             | \(g(s)\)     | \((s)g\)     |
    | trivial     | \(s\)        | \(s\)        |
    | left/right  | \(gs\)       | \(sg\)       |
    | translation | \(sg^{-1}\)  | \(g^{-1}s\)  |
    | adjoint     | \(gsg^{-1}\) | \(g^{-1}sg\)    |

    if \(g(s)=sg\), then \((gh)s=sgh\) and \(g(hs)=(sh)g\) not equal if the group is not commutative

    but if \(g(s)=sg^{-1}\), then \((gh)s=sh^{-1}g^{-1}\) and \(g(hs)=sh^{-1}g^{-1}\) which is equal
