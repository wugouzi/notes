** Introduction
    Compile time system:
    1. parsing: parsing, AST production
    2. semantic analysis: schema lookup, variable binding, type inference
    3. normalization, factorization, constant folding
    4. rewrite 1: view resolution, unnesting, deriving predicates
    5. plan generation: constructing the execution plan
    6. rewrite 2: refining the plan, pushing group
    7. code generation: producing the imperative plan


    Different optimization goals:
    * minimize response time
    * minimize resource consumption
    * minimize time to first tuple
    * maximize throughput

    Notation:
    * \(\cala(e)\): attributes of the tuples produces by \(e\)
    * \(\calf(e)\) free variable of the expression \(e\)
    * binary operators \(e_1\theta e_2\) usually require \(\cala(e_1)=\cala(e_2)\)
    * \(\rho_{a\to b(e)}\), rename
    * \(\Pi_A(e)\), projection
    * \(\sigma_p(e)\), selection, \(\{x\mid x\in e\wedge p(x)\}\)
    * \(e_1\bowtie_pe_2\), join, \(\{x\circ y\mid x\in e_1\wedge y\in e_2\wedge p(x\circ y)\}\)


    Different join implementations have different characteristics:
    * \(e_1\bowtie^{NL}e_2\) Nested Loop Join:
    * \(e_1\bowtie^{BNL}e_2\) Blockwise Nested Loop Join: Read chunks of \(e_1\) into memory and
      read \(e_2\) once for each chunk. Further improvement: Use hashing for equi-joins
    * \(e_1\bowtie^{SM}e_2\) Sort Merge Join: Equi-joins only
    * \(e_1\bowtie^{HH}e_2\) Hybrid-Hash Join: Partitions \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) into partitions that
      can be joined in memory. Equi-joins only

*** View Serializability
    As we have seen, FSR emphasizes steps that are alive in a schedule. However, since the semantics
    of a schedule and of the transactions occurring in a schedule are unknown, it is reasonable to
    require that in two equivalent schedules, each transaction reads the same values, independent of
    its liveliness.

    *Lost update anomaly*: \(L=r_1(x)r_2(x)w_1(x)w_2(x)c_1c_2\). History is not
    FSR,
     \(LRF(L)=\{(t_0,x,t_2),(t_2,x,t_\infty)\}\),
     \(LRF(t_1t_2)=\{(t_0,x,t_1),(t_1,x,t_2),(t_2,x,t_\infty)\}\) and
     \(LRF(t_2t_1)=\{(t_0,x,t_2),(t_2,x,t_1),(t_1,x,t_\infty)\}\)


     *Inconsistent read anomaly*: \(I=r_2(x)w_2(x)r_1(x)r_1(y)r_2(y)w_2(y)c_1c_2\), history is FSR
     \(LFR(I)=LFR(t_1t_2)=LFR(t_2t_1)=\{(t_0,x,t_2),(t_0,y,t_2),(t_2,x,t_\infty),(t_2,y,t_\infty)\}\)


     #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [View Equivalence]

     1. \(op(s)=op(s')\)

     For schedules \(s\) and \(s'\) the following statements hold.
     1. \(s\approx_v s'\) iff \(op(s)=op(s')\) and \(RF(s)=RF(s')\)
     2. \(s\approx_vs'\) iff \(D(s)=D(s')\)
     #+END_theorem

     #+BEGIN_proof
     1. \(\Rightarrow\): Consider a read step \(r_i(x)\) from \(s\).
        Then \(H_s[r_i(x)]=H_{s'}[r_i(x)]\) implies that if \(r_i(x)\) reads from some
        step \(w_j(x)\) in \(s\), the same holds in \(s'\), and vice versa.

        \(\Leftarrow\): If \(RF(s)=RF(s')\), this in particular applies to \(t_\infty\);
        hence \(H[s]=H[s']\). Similarly, for all other reads \(r_i(x)\) in \(s\), we
        have \(H_s[r_i(x)]=H_{s'}[r_i(x)]\).

        Suppose for some \(w_i(x)\), \(H_s[w_i(x)]\neq H_{s'}[w_i(x)]\). Thus the set of values read
        by \(t_i\) prior to step \(w_i\) is different in \(s\) and \(s'\), a contradiction to our
        assumption that \(RF(s)=RF(s')\).

**** Introduction
    General locking rules:
    1. Each data operation \(o_i(x)\) must be preceded by \(ol_i(x)\) and followed by \(ou_i(x)\)
    2. For each \(x\) and \(t_i\) there is at most one \(ol_i(x)\) and at most one \(ou_i(x)\)
    3. No \(ol_i(x)\)  or \(ou_i(x)\) is redundant
    4. If \(x\) is locked by both \(t_i\) and \(t_j\), then these locks are compatible

    Let \(DT(s)\) denote the projection of \(s\) onto the steps of type \(r,w,a,c\).
