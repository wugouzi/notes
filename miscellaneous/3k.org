Guru [Marq-L]: that will vary from player to player depending on what is most important to them.
Gold may be important to come, while cartography important to others.  For me as a Necromancer, I
               valued all of the Combat.Armor mskills to increase the effectiveness of my armour. I
also value the Combat.Proficiency.Disciplines, prioritzing Metaphysical which aligns with my
               primary spell school of Power.  The Disciplines give additional offensive and
defensive bouses with that type

Guru [Marq-L]: nog and crit and penetration and dodge are nice. most of the skills are useful.  The
regen ones for necs are just not though, as Atreyu mentioned
* Quotes
Buford says: There are reports some of the bandits fled into the
             magic mirror leading to Stetstar Station with one of the
             missing mirror fragments.  Perhaps you could look there.
