 and a small oak stake. You'll need 7 discs, one of each size, numbered from 1

Sometimes items get damaged in the handling, and need to be repaired before they can be sold.  This will be your task; you will be given a number of items to mend, and you should do your work in the shop.

Please bring your own needle and thread, or other equipment you think you will need.

Go to Jenny Tawdry at Tawdry Things on the Maudlin Bridge and report for work there.  Be there before Wed Nov 18 03:08:23 2020.
