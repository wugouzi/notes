   The parts you'll be looking for are a small golden disc, a small ebony plank
 and a small oak stake. You'll need 7 discs, one of each size, numbered from 1
 to 7. Also, the plank and stakes are easily recognized. The plank is made of
 ebony and it has three holes bored into it, to house three oak stakes which
 will have a distinguishing notch carved to one end. Are you sure you want to
 accept my task
