* Introduction
        VC mains a vector at each node which tracks the knowledge this node has about the logical clocks of
        other nodes.
* Preliminaries
        We use LC to denote the logical clock, and use \(lc.e\) to denote the timestamp assigned to event
        \(e\) by this algorithm.

        We use \(\hb\) to denote happens before relation, let
        \begin{equation*}
        e||f:=\neg(e\hb f)\wedge\neg(f\hb e)
        \end{equation*}
        We have
        \begin{gather*}
        e\hb\Rightarrow lc.e<lc.f\\
        lc.e=lc.f\Rightarrow e||f\\
        e\hb f\Leftrightarrow vc.e<vc.f
        \end{gather*}

** Problem statement
        Given a distributed system, assign each event \(e\) a timestamp, \(l.e\), s.t.
        1. \(e\hb f\Rightarrow l.e<l.f\)
        2. Space requirement for \(l.e\) is \(O(1)\) integers
        3. \(l.e\) is represented with bounded space
        4. \(l.e.\) is *close* to \(pt.e\), i.e., \(\abs{l.e-pt.e}\) is bounded. PT here means physical time
** Description of the Naive Algorithm
        Given the goal that \(l.e\) should be close to \(pt.e\), in the naive algorithm, we begin with the
        rule: /for any event \(e\)/, \(l.e\ge pt.e\). We design our algoirithm as shown in Figure [[ref:3]].

        Initially all \(l\) values are set to 0. When a send event, say \(f\), is created on node \(j\), we
        set \(l.f\) to be \(\max(l.e+1,pt.j)\), where \(e\) is the previous event on node \(j\). This ensures
        \(l.e<l.f\) and \(l.f\ge pt.f\).

        The algorithm satisfies the first two requirement. Consider figure [[ref:4]],
        #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .6\textwidth :float nil
        #+NAME: 4
        #+CAPTION: Counter example
        [[../../images/papers/81.png]]

        The root of the unbounded drift problem is due to the naive algorithm using \(l\) to maintain both the
        maximum of \(pt\) values seen so far and the logical clock increments from new events (local, send,
        receive). This makes the clocks lose information: it becomes unclear if the new \(l\) value came from
        \(pt\) (as in the message from node 0 to node 1) or from causality (as is the case for the rest of
        messages).

        As such, there is no suitable place to reset l value to bound the \(l-pt\) difference.
