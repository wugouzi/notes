* The basics of o-minimality

** Linearly ordered structures
    Assume here that \(\calm=\la M,<,\cdot\ra\) is a linearly ordered structure

    we take the order topology on \(M\) and the product topology on \(M^n\)

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_proposition
    1. There is a definable family of subsets of \(M^n\) which forms a basis for the topology on \(M^n\)
    #+END_proposition
