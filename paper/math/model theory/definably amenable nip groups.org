* Introduction
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_theorem
    Let \(G=G(\calu)\) be a definable NIP group with \(\calu\) a sufficiently saturated model. Then TFAE
    1. \(G\) is definably amenable(i.e., admits a \(G\)-invariant measure on its definable subsets)
    2. The action of \(G\) on \(S_G(\calu)\) admits a small orbit

    #+BEGIN_theorem
    Let \(G=G(\calu)\) be a definably amenable NIP group. Then TFAE for a definable set \(\phi(x)\):
    1. \(\phi(x)\) does not \(G\)-divide (i.e., there is no infinite sequence \((g_i)_{i<\omega}\) of
       elements of \(G\) and natural number \(k\) s.t. any \(k\) sets in \(\{g_i\phi(x)\}_{i<\omega}\) have
       empty intersection)
    2. \(\phi(x)\) is weakly generic
    3. \(\mu(\phi(x))>0\)  for some \(G\)-invariant measure \mu
    4. \(\phi(x)\) is \(f\)-generic (meaning that for any small model \(M\) over which \(\phi(x)\) is
       defined, no \(G\)-translate of \(\phi(x)\) forks over \(M\))
