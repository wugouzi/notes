* Abstract
        Bw-tree is a lock-free index that provides high throughput for transactional database workloads in SQL
        Server’s Hekaton engine. The Bw-Tree avoids locks by appending delta record to tree nodes and using an
        indirection layer that allows it to atomically update physical pointers using compare-and-swap (CaS).

        This paper has two contributions:
        1. First, it is the missing guide for how to build an *in-memory* lock-free Bw-Tree.
        2. our evaluation shows that despite our improvements, the Bw-Tree still does not perform as well as
           other concurrent data structures that use locks.


        Background HackerNews's [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5521029][discussion]].
* Introduction
        The high-level idea of the Bw-Tree is that it avoids locks by using an indirection layer that maps
        logical identifiers to physical pointers for the tree’s internal components. Threads then apply
        concurrent updates to a tree node by appending delta records to that node’s modification log.
        Subsequent operations on that node must replay these deltas to obtain its current state.


        The indirection layer and delta records provide two benefits.
        1. it avoids coherence traffic of locks by decomposing every global state change into atomic steps.
        2. it incurs fewer cache invalidations on a multi-core CPU because threads append delta records to
           make changes to the index instead of overwriting existing nodes.
* Bw-tree Essentials
        Assume that the Bw-Tree is deployed inside of a database management system with a thread pool, and has
        worker threads accessing the index to process queries. If non-cooperative garbage collection is used,pn
        the DBMS also launches one or more background threads periodically to perform garbage collection on
        the index.

        The most prominent difference between the Bw-Tree and other B+Tree-based indexes is that the Bw-Tree
        avoids directly editing tree nodes because it causes cache line invalidation. Instead, it stores
        modifications to a node in a delta record (e.g., insert, update, delete), and maintains a chain of
        such records for every node in the tree. This per-node structure, called a *Delta Chain*, allows the
        Bw-Tree to perform atomic updates via CaS. The *Mapping Table* serves as an indirection layer that maps
        logical node IDs to phisical pointers, making atomic updates of several references to a tree node
        possible.

        As in Fig. [[ref:fig1]], every node in the Bw-tree has a unique logical node ID (64-bit). Instead of
        using pointers, nodes refer to other nodes using these IDs (*logical links*). When a thread needs the
        physical location of a node, it consults the Mapping Table to translate a node ID to its memory
        address.
** Base Nodes and Delta Chains
        A *logical node* in the Bw-Tree has two components:
        1. a base node:
           1. *inner base node* holds a sorted (key, node ID) array
           2. *leaf base node* holds a sorted (key, value) array
        2. a Delta Chain.
        Initially, the Bw-Tree consists of two nodes, an empty leaf base node, and an inner base node that
        contains one separator item referring to the empty leaf node. Base nodes are immutable.

        As shown in Fig. ref:fig2, a Delta Chain is a singly linked list that contains a
        chronologically-ordered history of the modifications made to the base node. The entries in the Delta
        Chain are connected using physical pointers, with the tail pointing to the base node. The entries in
        the Delta Chain are connected using physical pointers, with the tail pointing to the base node. Both
        the base node and its delta records contain additional meta-data that represent the state of the
        logical node at that point in time. That is, when a worker thread updates a logical node, they compute
        the latest attributes of the logical node and store them in the delta record.

** Mapping Table
        Bw-Tree allows a thread to update all references to a node in a single CaS instruction that is
        available on all modern CPUs. If a thread's CaS fails then it aborts its operation and restarts. This
        restart is transparent to the higher-level DBMS components. Threads always restart an operation by
        traversing again from the tree's root. The nodes that a thread will revisit after a restart will
        likely be in the CPU cache anyway.
** Consolidation and Garbage Collection
        Worker threads will periodically consolidate a logical node’s delta records into a new base node.
        Consolidation is triggered when Delta Chain’s length exceeds some threshold. Microsoft reported that a
        length of eight was a good setting.

        At the beginning of consolidation, the thread copies the logical node’s base node contents to its
        private memory and then applies the Delta Chain. It then updates the node’s logical link in the
        Mapping Table with the new base node. After consolidation, the index reclaims the old base node and
        Delta Chain memory after all other threads in the system are finished accessing them.

        The original Bw-Tree uses a centralized epoch-based garbage collection scheme to determine when it is
        safe to reclaim memory
** Structural Modification
        As with a B+Tree, a Bw-Tree’s logical node is subject to overflow or underflow. These cases require
        *splitting* a logical node with too many items into two separate nodes or *merging* together underfull
        nodes into a new node. Bw-Tree’s *structural modification* (SMO) protocols for handling node splits and
        merges without using locks. The main idea is to use special delta records to represent internal
        structural modifications.

        The SMO operation is divided into two phases:
        1. *logical phase*: appends special deltas to notify other threads of an ongoing SMO

           some thread \(t\) appends a \(\dinsert\), \(\dmerge\) or \(\dremove\) to the virtual node, updating
           its attributes such as the high key and next node ID. The updated attributes guarantee that other
           worker threads always observe consistent virtual node states during their traversal

        2. *physical phase*: performs the SMO

           \(t'\) (not necessarily the same thread at \(t\)) will split or merge the node, and then replace
           the old virtual node with the new node via CaS

           Although the Bw-Tree is lock-free, threads are not guaranteed to make progress because of failed
           CaS. One way to alleviate this starvation is for threads to cooperatively complete a multi-stage SMO, which in known as the *help-along protocol*.
