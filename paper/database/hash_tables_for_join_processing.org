* Introduction
        Observations:
        1. Joins are asymmetric, with small build and large probe sides
        2. Joins are selective, with many probes not finding a match in the hash table
        3. Join must be scalable, as inputs can be large, and CPU cores are plentiful,
        4. Joins can have duplicates, many tuples sharing few keys

        Our hash table combines the techniques of build side partitioning, adjacency array layout, pipelined
        probes, Bloom filters, and software write-combine buffers to achieve high performance on a wide range
        of queries.
* Design Criteria
        *Joins are selective*. Many probe-side tuples will not find matches

        | Radix-Join      | N          | Y        | N      | N      |
        | Chaining        | Y          | Y        | ~      | Y      |
        | 3D Chaining     | Y          | N        | Y      | N      |
        | Unchained       | Y          | Y        | Y      | ~      |
* Approach
** Layout
        Open addressing schemes store all tuples in a single contiguous array, which is efficient for probing
        with non-selective predicates and no duplicate keys. When the join is selective, open addressing
        schemes cannot efficiently filter out non-matching tuples. When there are tuples with duplicate keys,
        these tuples collide with other keys leading to high build and probe costs.

        In contrast, chaining hash tables build a *directory* that is separate from the tuples. The directory
        entries point to the tuples that share the same hash prefix, which are then chained in linked lists,
        reducing collisions due to duplicates.

        However, the linked list traversal is costly, especially for long chains. To address these issues, we
        propose the *unchained* hash table layout that combines the benefits of both open addressing and
        chaining.

        Tuples are stored in a contiguous buffer ordered by their hash prefixes. The directory consists of
        entries representing ranges of tuples sharing hash prefixes. Each entry contains a tiny Bloom filter
        and a pointer to the range. When probing, the hash prefix is used to index into the directory, suffix
        is used to check the Bloom filter, and the pointer is followed to the range of matching tuples.

        Since joins are typically selective, only a fraction of the tuples on the probe side are passed on. It
        is, therefore, crucial to eliminate tuples without a join partner efficiently and early on. We embed a
        register-blocked Bloom filter in every slot in the directory to probabilistically discard tuples that
        definitively do not have a join partner.

        For efficient access, we store the pointer in the upper bits and the filter in the lower bits. The
        Bloom filters are checked before accessing the tuple storage and can also be pushed into other
        operators as semi-join reducers

** Efficient Probes
        #+begin_src c++
u64 shift; // Used to reduce a hash to a directory slot
u64 directory [1 << (64 - shift)];
void lookup(K key, u64 hash) {
  u64 slot = hash >> shift;         // shr
  u64 entry = directory[slot];      // mov
  if (!couldContain((u16)entry,hash)) return;
  produceMatches(key, slot, entry);
}

void produceMatches(K key, u64 slot, u64 entry) {
  T* start = directory[slot - 1] >> 16;
  T* end = entry >> 16;
  for (T* cur = start; cur != end; ++ cur )
    if (cur->key == key)
      produce(cur);
}

u16 tags [1 << 11]; // Precalculated 4 bit Bloom filter tags
bool couldContain(u16 entry, u64 hash) {
  u16 slot = ((u32)hash) >> (32 - 11);   // shr
  u16 tag = tags[slot];                  // mov
  return !(tag & ~entry);                // andn
}
        #+end_src

        Due to join selectivity, the hottest path during join processing is filtering out the tuples that do
        not find a join partner. For filtering, we use a per-slot register blocked Bloom filters with 16 bits.
        To achieve a low false positive rate, we set 4 bits for each tuple in the slot, which allows us to
        discard probe tuples where any of the corresponding bits in the filter are not set.

        Our implementation uses an optimization to calculate and subsequently test all four bits of the tag at
        once. In a naïve implementation, calculating this tag requires over a dozen instructions to calculate
        the positions of the bits. To avoid these in the hot path, we instead use a precomputed lookup table
        that stores the \(\binom{16}{4}=1820\) distinct bit patterns and load them in a single instruction.
        Note that we pad this lookup table to \(2^{11}=2048\) entries with uniformly random sampled tags to be
        able to calculate an index with a single shift instruction. To test if all are set in the Bloom
        filter, we bitwise complement the filter and bitwise and it with the computed tag.

        Using the precomputed lookup table has several desirable properties compared to computing tags on the
        fly:
        1. the precomputed tags only require 4 KB of memory, at most consuming 1 TLB entry. Thus, loading a
           tag is almost as cheap as computing a single bit tag on the fly
        2. the 4 bit tag has a significantly lower false positive rate.


        Overhead for filter is low for low selectivity:
        #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .5\textwidth :float nil
        #+NAME:
        #+CAPTION:
        [[../../images/papers/67.png]]


        #+ATTR_LATEX: :width .7\textwidth :float nil
        #+NAME:
        #+CAPTION:
        [[../../images/papers/68.png]]
        For our hash table load factor of 65%, 4 bits per tuple with 1820 tags is optimal with false positive
        rate 1/169. The padded lookup table with 2048 tags has a slightly higher false positive rate of 1/168.

        To get few collisions in the directory slots, we need a well-distributed hash function. We use a large
        amount of the bits from the 64-bit hash values, since slot selection uses the upper bits and the Bloom
        filter tags the lower bits. For efficient calculation of these hashes, we use CRC instructions which
        are well supported and have good properties for hash tables.
        #+begin_src c++
u64 hash32 (u32 key, u32 seed) {
  u64 k = 0x8648DBDB;            // Mixing constant
  u32 crc = crc32(seed, key);    // crc32
  return crc * ((k << 32) + 1);  // imul
}
u64 hash64 (u64 key, u32 seed1, u32 seed2) {
  u64 k = 0 x2545F4914F6CDD1D;   // Mixing constant
  u32 crc1 = crc32(seed1 , key); // crc32
  u32 crc2 = crc32(seed2 , key); // crc32
  u64 upper = crc2 << 32;        // shl
  u64 combined = crc1 | upper;   // or
  return combined * k;           // imul
}
        #+end_src

        For 32-bit inputs, we use a single crc32 instruction and a multiplication with a mixing constant. For
        64-bit inputs, we require two crc32 instructions as the individual CRC digests are only 32-bits. The
        resulting specialized hash functions allow efficient filtering of tuples in the hash table, and only
        need about 10 instructions between loading the value from its base table to a Bloom filter check.

        Afterwards, we can produce all matches by iterating over the collision list. In chaining hash tables,
        this requires traversing a linked list with expensive dependent loads of the next pointers. In
        contrast, our unchained table determines the range of collisions from a neighboring slot in the
        directory, allowing efficient iteration over the collision list.

** Parallel Build
*** Parallel Collection
        The tuple collection is often bottlenecked by the memory allocator as many individual tuples need to
        be allocated and materialized concurrently. To avoid this bottleneck, we use a slab allocator that
        allocates memory in large chunks and then hands out memory from these chunks to individual tuples.

        #+begin_src c++
GlobalAllocator &level1;
BumpAlloc level2 , level3[numPartitions];
size_t counts[numPartitions];
void consume(T tuple) {
  u64 part = tuple.hash >> (64 - log2(numPartitions));
  if (level3[part].freeSpace() < sizeof(tuple)) {
    if (level2.freeSpace() < sizeof(BumpAlloc))
      level2.addSpace(level1.allocate<LargeChunk>());
  }

  level3[part].addSpace(level2.allocate<SmallChunk>());
  *level3[part]->allocate<T>() = tuple;
  counts[part] += 1;
}
        #+end_src
        The first level allocates memory in chunks for each thread, the second level allocates smaller chunks
        per partitions, and the third layer allocates individual tuples from the small chunks.
*** Tuple Counting
        We need to construct the directory and copy the tuples over to the final compact tuple storage.

        To copy tuples over to their final location, we need to first determine the ranges in which tuples
        that share the same hash prefix will be stored. This is done by counting the number of tuples per
        directory entry. The counts in the directory are then post-processed with an exclusive prefix sum to
        determine the ranges in which tuples will be stored. The ranges are then used to copy tuples to their
        corresponding location in the final storage.
*** Copies
        After the counting, each directory entry contains the start of the range of tuples that share the same
        hash prefix.

        #+begin_src c++
T partitionTuples [][];
T *tupleStorage;
void postProcessBuild(u64 partition, u64 prevCount) {
  for (T tuple : partitionTuples[partition]) {
    u64 slot = tuple.hash >> shift;
    directory[slot] += sizeof(T) << 16;
    directory[slot] |= computeTag(tuple.hash);
  }
  // prevCount is the total tuple count of previous partitions
  u64 cur = tupleStorage + prevCount ;
  u64 k = 64 - shift ;
  u64 start = (partition << k) / numPartitions ;
  u64 end = ((partition + 1) << k) / numPartitions ;
  for (u64 i = start; i < end; ++ i) {
    u64 val = directory[i] >> 16;
    directory[i] = (cur << 16) | ((u16) directory [i]);
    cur += val;
  }
  for (T tuple : partitionTuples[partition]) {
    u64 slot = tuple.hash >> shift;
    T *target = directory[slot] >> 16;
    *target = tuple;
    directory[slot] += sizeof(T) << 16;
  }
}
        #+end_src
** Handling Large Tuple Sizes
        Copying the tuples remains relatively cheap as long as the tuples are small enough to fit into a cache
        line. Note that all tuples with size not greater than twice the CPU’s vector width can be copied with
        just two load and two store instructions. This can be accomplished by using the largest vector width
        not larger than the tuple’s size and then using one load/store pair for the start of the tuple and one
        load/store pair for the end. For example, if our tuple is 24 bytes, and the CPU’s vector width is 16
        bytes, our first load/store pair copies the bytes 0–15 and the second pair copies the bytes 8–23.

        If tuples are very large, we need an alternative approach for build efficiency. In this case, we chain
        the tuples in a linked list instead of copying them to contiguous storage. This makes the build
        process somewhat more efficient, as we do not need to copy the tuples. However, we have to update
        linked list pointers within tuples, which, due to memory write amplification, result in entire cache
        lines containing the pointers being written back to memory. Still, for tuples larger than one cache
        line, linking can be worth it.

  u64 slot = tuple.hash >> (64 - k);
  u64 prevEntry;
  xchg(directory[slot], prevEntry);
  tuple.next = prevEntry >> 16;
  u16 tag = computeTag(tuple . hash);
  directory[slot] |= ((u16)prevEntry) | tag;
}
