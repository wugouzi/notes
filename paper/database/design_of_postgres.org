* Abstract
        Design goal:
        1. provide better support for complex objects
        2. provide user extendibility for data types, operators and access methods
        3. provide facilities for active database (i.e., alterters, triggers) and inferencing including
           forward- and backward-chaining
        4. simplify the DBMS code for crash recovery
        5. produce a design that can take advantage of optical disks, workstations composed of multiple
           tightly-coupled processors, and custom designed VLSI chips
        6. makes a few changes as possible to the relational model.

        The paper describes the query language, programming langauge interface, system architecture, query
        processing strategy, and storage system for the new system.
