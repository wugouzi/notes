* Ordered structures
    By an *ordered structure* we mean a first order structure \(\calm=\la M,<,\dots\ra\) where < is a dense linear
    ordering on \(M\)

    We fix an ordered structure \(\calm\)

    By definable we mean definable with parameters from \(M\)

    By an interval we mean an interval in \(M\) with endpoints in \(M\cup\{\pm\infty\}\)

    For a function \(f\) we will denote by \(\Gamma(f)\) the graph of \(f\)

    For definable \(X\subseteq M^n\) and \(Y\subseteq M^k\), we say that a function \(f:X\to Y\) is definable if the
    graph of \(f\) is a definable subset of \(M^n\times M^k\)

    For a set \(X\subseteq M^k\), we will denote by \(X^c\) the complement of \(X\)

    we use \(\la a,b\ra\) to denote an ordered pair

    we use the order topology on \(M\) and the product topology on \(M^k\)

    #+BEGIN_proposition
    If \(X\) is a definable subset of \(M^n\) then the topological closure and interior of \(X\) are definable
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    interior of \(X\) is the union of open sets contained in \(X\)

    closure of \(X\) is the intersection of all closed sets containing \(X\)

    #+BEGIN_proposition
    Let \(A\subseteq M^n\) be a definable set and \(f:A\to M\) a definable function
    1. \(\{a\in A:f\text{ is continuous at }a\}\) is definable
    2. The function \(x\mapsto\lim_{t\to x}f(t)\) is definable
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_proof
    1. \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) iff \(\forall V\ni f(a)\exists U\ni a\) s.t. \(f(U)\subset V\) iff
       \(\forall x<f(a)<y\exists x'<a<y'\) s.t. \(\forall x'<u<y'\exists x<y<y\) s.t. \(f(u)=v\)
    #+END_proof

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Uniform definability]
    #+BEGIN_proposition
    Let \(\{X_a:a\in M^k\}\) be a uniformly definable family of subsets of \(M^n\), then
    1. the family \(\{cl(X_a):a\in M_k\}\) is also uniformly definable
    2. the sets of all \(a\in M^k\) s.t. \(X_a\) is a discrete set, an open set, a closed set, a
       bounded set, nowhere dense set are definable
    #+END_proposition

    #+BEGIN_exercise
    Let \(\calm\) be an \(\aleph_1\)-sturated ordered structure
    1. Show that a sequence \((a_i)_{i\in\N}\) in \(\calm\) is convergent iff its eventually constant
