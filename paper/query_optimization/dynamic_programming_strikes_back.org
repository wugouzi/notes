* Introduction
        In this paper, we introduct ~DPhyp~. Experiments will shwo that it is highly superior to existing
        approaches.

* Hypergraphs
** Definitions
        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Hypergraph]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        A *hypergraph* is a pair \(H=(V,E)\) s.t.
        1. \(V\) is a non-empty set of nodes
        2. \(E\) is a set of hyperedges, where a *hyperedge* is an unordered pair \((u,v)\) of non-empty subsets
           of \(V\) (\(u\subset V\) and \(v\subset V\)) with the additional condition that \(u\cap
           v=\emptyset\)

        We call any non-empty subset of \(V\) a *hypernode*. We assume that the nodes in \(V\) are totally
        ordered via an (arbitrary) relation \(\prec\). The ordering on nodes is important for our algorithm.

        A hyperedge \((u,v)\) is *simple* if \(\abs{u}=\abs{v}=1\). A hypergraph is *simple* if all its hyperedges
        are simple.
        #+END_definition

        In our context, the nodes of hypergraphs are relations and the edges are abstractions of join
        predicates. Consider a join predicate of the form
        \begin{equation*}
        R_1.a+R_2.b+R_3.c=R_4.d+R_5.e+R_6.f
        \end{equation*}
        This predicate will result in a hyperedge \((\{R_1,R_2,R_3\}, \{R_4,R_5,R_6\})\).

        Fig [[ref:2]] contains an example of a hypergraph. The set \(V\) of nodes is \(V=\{R_1,\dots,R_6\}\). Concerning the node ordering, we assume that
        \(R_i\prec R_j\Leftrightarrow i<j\). There are simple edges \((\{R_1\},\{R_2\})\),
        \((\{R_2\},\{R_3\})\), \((\{R_4\},\{R_5\})\) nad \((\{R_5\},\{R_6\})\).

        Note that is possible to rewrite the above complex join predicate. For example, it is equivalent to
        \begin{equation*}
        R_1.a+R_2.b=R_4.d+R_5.e+R_6.f-R_3.c
        \end{equation*}
        This leads to a hyperedge \((\{R_1,R_2\},\{R_3,R_4,R_5,R_6\})\).

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Subgraph]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        Let \(H=(V,E)\) be a hypergraph and \(V'\subseteq V\) a subset of nodes. The *node induced subgraph*
        \(G|_{V'}\) of \(G\) is defined as \(G|_{V'}=(V',E')\) with \(E'=\{(u,v)\mid (u,v)\in E,u\subseteq
        V',v\subseteq V'\}\).
        The node ordering on \(V'\) is the restriction of the node ordering of \(V\).
        #+END_definition

        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Connected]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        Let \(H=(V,E)\) be a hypergraph. \(H\) is connected if \(\abs{V}=1\) or if there exists a partitioning
        \(V'\), \(V''\) of \(V\) and a hyperedge \((u,v)\in E\) s.t. \(u\subseteq V'\), \(v\subseteq V''\) and
        both \(G|_{V'}\) and \(G|_{V''}\) are connected.
        #+END_definition

        Let \(H=(V,E)\) is a hypergraph and \(V'\subseteq V\) is a subset of the nodes s.t. the node-induced
        subgraph \(G|_{V'}\) is connected, then we call \(V'\) a *connected subgraph* or *csg* for short. The
        number of connected subgraphs is important for dynamic programming: it directly corresponds to the
        number of entries in the dynamic programming table. If a node set \(V''\subseteq(V\setminus V')\)
        induces a connected subgraph \(G|_{V''}\), we call \(V''\) a *connected complement* of \(V'\) or *cmp* for
        short.

        Within this paper, _we will assume that all hypergraphs are connected_. This way, we can make sure that
        no cross products are needed. However, when dealing with hypergraphs, this condition can easily be
        assured by adding according hyperedges: for every pair of connected components, we can add a hyperedge
        whose hypernodes contain exactly the relations of the connected components. By considering these
        hyperedges as \(\bowtie\) operators with selectivity 1, we get an equivalent connected hypergraph
** Csg-cmp-pair
        #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Csg-cmp-pair]
        #+BEGIN_definition
        Let \(H=(V,E)\) be a hypergraph and \(S_1\), \(S_2\) two subsets of \(V\) s.t. \(S_1\subseteq V\) and
        \(S_2\subseteq(V\setminus S_1)\) are a connected subgraph and a connected complement. If there further
        exists a hyperedge \((u,v)\in E\) s.t. \(u\subseteq S_1\) and \(v\subseteq S_2\), we call
        \((S_1,S_2)\) a *csg-cmp-pair*.
        #+END_definition

        We will restrict the enumeration of csg-cmp-pairs to those \((S_1,S_2)\) which satisfy the condition
        that \(\min(S_1)\prec\min(S_2)\).

        Obviously, in order to be correct, any dynamic programming algorithm has to consider all
        csg-cmp-pairs. Further, only these have to be considered. Thus, the minimal number of cost function
        calls of any dynamic programming algorithm is exactly the number of csg-cmp-pairs for a given
        hypergraph. Note that the number of connected subgraphs is far smaller than the number of
        csg-cmp-pairs.

        The problem now is to enumerate the csg-cmp-pairs efficiently and in an order
        acceptable for dynamic programming. The latter can be expressed more specifically. Before enumerating
        a csg-cmp-pair \((S_1,S_2)\), all csg-cmp-pairs \(S_1',S_2'\) with \(S_1'\subseteq S\) and
        \(S_2'\subseteq S_2\) have to be enumerated.
** Neighborhood
        The main idea to generate csg-cmp-pairs is to incrementally expand connected subgraphs by considering
        new nodes in the *neighborhood* of a subgraph. Informally, the neighborhood \(N(S)\) under an exclusion
        set \(X\) consists of all nodes reachable from \(S\) that are not in \(X\). We derive an exact
        definition below

        When choosing subsets of the neighborhood for inclusion, we have to treat a hypernode as a single
        instance: either all of its nodes are inside an enumerated subset or none of them. Since we want to
        use the fast subset enumeration procedure introduced by Vance and Maier, we must have a single bit
        representing a hypernode and also single bits for relations occurring in simple edges. Since these may
        overlap, we are constained to choose one unique representative of every hypernode occuring in a
        hyperedge. We choose the node \(\min(S)\).

        Let \(S\) be a current set, which we want to expand by adding further relations. Consider a hyperedge
        \((u,v)\) with \(u\subseteq S\). Then we will add \(\min(v)\) to the neighborhood of \(S\). However,
        we have to make sure that the missing elements of \(v\), i.e., \(v\setminus\min(v)\), are also
        contained in any set emitted. We thus define
        \begin{equation*}
        \bbar{\min}(S)=S\setminus \min(S)
        \end{equation*}

        We define the set of non-subsumed hyperedges as the minimal subset \(E\downarrow\) of \(E\) s.t. for
        all \((u,v)\in E\) there exists a hyperedge \((u',v')\in E\downarrow\) with \(u'\subseteq u\) and
        \(v'\subseteq v\). Additionally, we make sure that none of the nodes of a hypernode are contained in a
        set \(X\), which is to be excluded from neighborhood considerations. We thus define a set containing
        the *interesting hypernodes* for given sets \(S\) and \(X\). We do so in two steps.
        1. Collect the potentially interesting hypernodes into a set \(E\downarrow'(S,X)\) and then minimize
           this set to eliminate subsumed hypernodes:
           \begin{equation*}
           E\downarrow'(S,X)=\{v\mid (u,v)\in E,u\subseteq S,v\cap S=\emptyset,v\cap X=\emptyset\}
           \end{equation*}
        2. Define \(E\downarrow(S,X)\) to be the minimal set of hypernodes s.t. for all
           \(v\in E\downarrow'(S,X)\) there exists a hypernode \(v'\) in \(E\downarrow(S,X)\) s.t.
           \(v'\subseteq v\).



        We now define the *neighborhood* of a hypernode \(S\), given a set of excluded nodes \(X\), to be:
        \begin{equation*}
        \caln(S,X)=\bigcup_{v\in E\downarrow(S,X)}\min(v)
        \end{equation*}
        For hypergraph in Fig [[ref:2]] and with \(X=S=\{R_1,R_2,R_3\}\), we have
        \begin{gather*}
        E\downarrow'(S,X)=\{\{R_4,R_5,R_6\}\}\\
        E\downarrow(S,X)=\{\{R_4,R_5,R_6\}\}\\
        \caln(S,X)=\{R_4\}
        \end{gather*}
* The algorithm
        High level:
        1. Constructs ccps (csg-cmp-pair) by enumerating connected subgraphs from an increasing part of the query graph
        2. both the primary connected subgraphs and its connected complement are created by recursive graph traversals
        3. during traversal, some nodes are *forbidden* to avoid creating duplicates
        4. connected subgraphs are increased by following edges to neighboring nodes. For this purpose
           hyperedges are interpretaed as \(n:1\) edges, leading from \(n\) of one side to one canonical nodes
           of the other side.

        Summarizing the above, the algorithm traverses the graph in a fixed order and recursively produces
        larger connected sub- graphs.

        We give the implementation of our join ordering algorithm for hypergraphs by means of pseudocode for
        member functions of a class ~DPhyp~.

        The whole algorithm is distributed over five subroutines.
        * The top-level routine ~Solve~ initializes the dynamic programming table with access plans for single
          relations and then calls ~EmitCsg~ and ~EnumerateCsgRec~ for each set containing exactly one relation.
        * The member function ~EnumerateCsgRec~ is responsible for enumerating connected subgraphs. It does so
          by calculating the neighborhood and iterating over each of its subset.
        * For each such subset \(S_1\) , ~EnumerateCsgRec~ calls ~EmitCsg~. This member function is responsible
          for finding suitable complements.
        * ~EmitCsg~ does so by calling ~EnumerateCmpRec~, which recursively enumerates the complements \(S_2\) for
          the connected subgraph \(S_1\) found before.
        * The pair \((S_1,S_2)\) is a csg-cmp-pair. For every such pair, ~EmitCsgCmp~ is called. Its main
          responsibility is to consider a plan built up from the plans for \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) .

** Solve
        \begin{align*}
        &\texttt{Solve}()\\
        &\textbf{for each }v\in V\quad\text{// initialize dpTable}\\
        &\quad\text{dpTable}[\{v\}]=\text{plan for }v\\
        &\textbf{for each }v\in V\textbf{ descending }\text{according to }\prec\\
        &\quad\texttt{EmitCsg}(\{v\})\quad\text{// process singleton sets}\\
        &\quad\texttt{EnumerateCsgRec}(\{v\},\calb_v)\quad\text{// expand singleton sets}\\
        &\textbf{return }\text{dpTable}[V]
        \end{align*}
        The algorithm calls \(\texttt{EmitCsg}(\{v\})\) for single nodes \(v\in V\) to generate all
        csg-cmp-pairs \((\{v\,S_2\})\) via calls to ~EnumerateCsgCmp~ and ~EmitCsgCmp~, where \(v\prec\min(S_2)\) holds.
** EnumerateCsgRec
        The general purpose of ~EnumerateCsgRec~ is to extend a given set \(S_1\), which induces a connected
        subgraph of \(G\) to a larger set with the same property.
        \begin{align*}
        &\texttt{EnumerateCsgRec}(S_1,X)\\
        &\textbf{for each }N\subseteq\caln(S_1,X):N\neq\emptyset\\
        &\quad\textbf{if }\text{dpTable}[S_1\cup N]\neq\emptyset\\
        &\quad\quad\texttt{EmitCsg}(S_1\cup N)\\
        &\textbf{for each }N\subseteq\caln(S_1,X):N\neq\emptyset\\
        &\quad\texttt{EnumerateCsgRec}(S_1\cup N,X\cup\caln(S_1,X))
        \end{align*}
** EmitCsg
        ~EmitCsg~ takes as an argument a non-empty, proper subset \(S_1\) of \(V\), which induces a connected
        subgraph. It is then responsible to generate the seeds for all \(S_2\) s.t. \((S_1,S_2)\) becomes a
        csg-cmp-pair.

        All nodes that have ordered before the smallest element in \(S_1\) (captured by the set
        \(\calb_{\min(S_1)}\)) are removed from the neighborhood to avoid duplicate enumerations.
        \begin{align*}
        &\texttt{EmitCsg}(S_1)\\
        &X=S_1\cup\calb_{\min(S_1)}\\
        &N=\caln(S_1,X)\\
        &\textbf{for each }v\in N\textbf{ descending }\text{according to }\prec\\
        &\quad S_2=\{v\}\\
        &\quad\textbf{if }\exists(u,v)\in E:u\subseteq S_1\wedge v\subseteq S_2\\
        &\quad\quad\texttt{EmitCsgCmp}(S_1,S_2)\\
        &\quad\texttt{EnumerateCmpRec}(S_1,S_2,X)
        \end{align*}
** EnumerateCmpRec
        ~EnumerateCsgRec~ has three parameters. The first parameter \(S_1\) is only used to pass it to
        ~EmitCsgCmp~. The second parameter is a set \(S_2\) which is connected and must be extended until a
        valid csg-cmp-pair is reached. Therefore, it considers the neighborhood of \(S_2\). For every
        non-empty, proper subset \(N\) of the neighborhood, it checks whether \(S_2\cup N\) induces a
        connected subset and is connected \(S_1\). If so, we have a vlid csg-cmp-pair

        \begin{align*}
        &\texttt{EnumerateCmpRec}(S_1,S_2,X)\\
        &\textbf{for each }N\subseteq\caln(S_2,X):N\neq\emptyset\\
        &\quad\textbf{if }\text{dpTable}[S_2\cup N]\neq\emptyset\wedge\\
        &\quad\quad\quad\exists(u,v)\in E:u\subseteq S_1\wedge v\subseteq S_2\cup N\\
        &\quad\quad\texttt{EmitCsgCmp}(S_1,S_2\cup N)\\
        &X=X\cup\caln(S_2,X)\\
        &\textbf{for each }N\subseteq\caln(S_2,X):N\neq\emptyset\\
        &\quad\texttt{EnumerateCmpRec}(S_1,S_2\cup N,X)
        \end{align*}
** EmitCsgCmp
        The task of \(\texttt{EmitCsgCmp}(S_1,S_2)\) is to join the optimal plans for \(S_1\) and \(S_2\),
        which must form a csg-cmp-pair

        For a given hypergraph \(G=(V,E)\) and a hyperedge \((u,v)\in E\), we denote by \(\calp(u,v)\) the
        predicate represented by the hyperedge \((u,v)\)

        \begin{align*}
        &\texttt{EmitCsgCmp}(S_1,S_2)\\
        &\text{plan}_1=\text{dpTable}[S_1]\\
        &\text{plan}_2=\text{dpTable}[S_2]\\
        &S=S_1\cup S_2\\
        &\text{newplan}=\text{plan}_1\bowtie_p\text{plan}_2\\
        &p=\wedge_{(u_1,u_2)\in E,u_i\subseteq S_i}\calp(u_1,u_2)\\
        &\textbf{if }\text{dpTable}[S]=\emptyset\vee\text{cost}(\text{newplan})<\text{cost}(\text{dpTable}[S])\\
        &\quad\text{dpTable}=\text{newplan}\\
        &\text{newplan}=\text{plan}_2\bowtie_p\text{plan}_1\\
        &p=\wedge_{(u_1,u_2)\in E,u_i\subseteq S_i}\calp(u_1,u_2)\\
        &\textbf{if }\text{cost}(\text{newplan})<\text{cost}(\text{dpTable}[S])\\
        &\quad\text{dpTable}=\text{newplan}\\
        \end{align*}
        The calculation of the predicate \(p\) seems to be expensive, since all edges have to be tested.
        However, we can attach the set of predicates
        \begin{equation*}
        p_S=\{\calp(u,v)\mid(u,v)\in E,u\subseteq S\}
        \end{equation*}
        to any plan class \(S\subseteq V\). If we represent the \(p_S\) by a bit vector, then for a
        csg-cmp-pair we can easily calculate \(p_{S_1}\cap p_{S_2}\) and just consider the result

        Omitted, not that interesting

** Considered Binary Operators
        Let us define the set of binary operators which we allow for in our plans. Besides the fully
        reorderable join (\(\bowtie\)), we also consider the following operators with limited reorderability
        capabilities: full outer join (\(\fullouterjoin\)), left outer join (\(\leftouterjoin\)), left
        antijoin (\(\rhd\)), left semijoin (\(\ltimes\)), and left nestjoin.

        Additionally to the above operators, we consider their dependent variants.
