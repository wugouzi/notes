* Motivation

** Achieving fault tolerance with replicated state machines
        Keeping the replicated log consistent is the job of the consensus algorithm. The consensus module on a
        server receives commands from clients and adds them to its log. It communicates with the consensus
        modules on other servers to ensure that every log eventually contains the same requests in the same
        order, even if some servers fail. Once commands are properly replicated, they are said to be
        *committed*. Each serverâ€™s state machine processes committed commands in log order, and the outputs are
        returned to clients. As a result, the servers appear to form a single, highly reliable state machine.
* Basic Raft algorithm
